    "original_text": "What is Bitcoin?\nBitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous person or team who outlined the technology in a 2008 white paper. It\u2019s an appealingly simple concept: bitcoin is digital money that allows for secure peer-to-peer transactions on the internet.\nUnlike services like Venmo and PayPal, which rely on the traditional financial system for permission to transfer money and on existing debit/credit accounts, bitcoin is decentralized: any two people, anywhere in the world, can send bitcoin to each other without the involvement of a bank, government, or other institution.\nEvery transaction involving Bitcoin is tracked on the blockchain, which is similar to a bank\u2019s ledger, or log of customers\u2019 funds going in and out of the bank. In simple terms, it\u2019s a record of every transaction ever made using bitcoin.\nUnlike a bank\u2019s ledger, the Bitcoin blockchain is distributed across the entire network. No company, country, or third party is in control of it; and anyone can become part of that network.\nThere will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. This is digital money that cannot be inflated or manipulated in any way.\nIt isn\u2019t necessary to buy an entire bitcoin: you can buy just a fraction of one if that\u2019s all you want or need.\nKey Questions\nWhat is BTC?\nBTC is the abbreviation for bitcoin.\nIs Bitcoin cryptocurrency?\nYes, bitcoin is the first widely adopted cryptocurrency, which is just another way of saying digital money.\nIs there a simple bitcoin definition?\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency used for encrypted, peer-to-peer transactions without needing a central bank\nWhat's the price of bitcoin?\nThe current price of Bitcoin can be found on Coinbase's website.\nIs Bitcoin an investment opportunity?\nLike any other asset, you can make money by buying BTC low and selling high, or lose money in the inverse scenario.\nAt what price did Bitcoin start?\nOne BTC was valued at a fraction of a U.S. penny in early 2010. During the first quarter of 2011, it exceeded a dollar. In late 2017, its value skyrocketed, topping out at close to $20,000, and Bitcoin ended up topping $64,899 in November 2021. You can track the price of bitcoin here.\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency used for encrypted, peer-to-peer transactions without needing a central bank\nWhat Is Bitcoin? by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Buy your first Bitcoin Start with as little as $25 Get started\nBitcoin Basics\nSince Bitcoin\u2019s creation, thousands of new cryptocurrencies have been launched, but bitcoin (abbreviated as BTC) remains the largest by market capitalization and trading volume.\n\nDepending on your goals, bitcoin can function as\n- an investment vehicle\n- a store of value similar to gold\n- a way to transfer value around the world\n- even just a way to explore an emerging technology\nBitcoin is a currency native to the Internet. Unlike government-issued currencies such as the dollar or euro, Bitcoin allows online transfers without a middleman such as a bank or payment processor. The removal of those gatekeepers creates a whole range of new possibilities, including the potential for money to move around the global internet more quickly and cheaply, and allowing individuals to have maximum control over their own assets.\nBitcoin is legal to use, hold, and trade, and can be spent on everything from travel to charitable donations. It\u2019s accepted as payment by businesses including Microsoft and Expedia.\nIs bitcoin money? It\u2019s been used as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account\u2014which are all properties of money. Meanwhile, it only exists digitally; there is no physical version of it.\nWho created Bitcoin?\nTo really grasp how bitcoin works, it helps to start at the beginning. The question of who created bitcoin is a fascinating one, because a decade after inventing the technology\u2014and despite a lot of digging by journalists and members of the crypto community\u2014its creator remains anonymous.\nThe principles behind Bitcoin first appeared in a white paper published online in late 2008 by a person or group going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto.\nThis paper wasn\u2019t the first idea for digital money drawing on the fields of cryptography and computer science\u2014in fact, the paper referred to earlier concepts\u2014but it was a uniquely elegant solution to the problem of establishing trust between different online entities, where people may be hidden (like bitcoin\u2019s own creator) by pseudonyms, or physically located on the other side of the planet.\nNakamoto devised a pair of intertwined concepts: the bitcoin private key and the blockchain ledger. When you hold bitcoin, you control it through a private key\u2014a string of randomized numbers and letters that unlocks a virtual vault containing your purchase. Each private key is tracked on the virtual ledger called the blockchain.\nWhen Bitcoin first appeared, it marked a major advance in computer science, because it solved a fundamental problem of commerce on the internet: how do you transfer value between two people without a trusted intermediary (like a bank) in the middle? By solving that problem, the invention of bitcoin has wide-ranging ramifications: As a currency designed for the internet, it allows for financial transactions that range across borders and around the globe without the involvement of banks, credit-card companies, lenders, or even governments. When any two people\u2014wherever they might live\u2014can send payments to each other without encountering those gatekeepers, it creates the potential for an open financial system that is more efficient, more free, and more innovative. That, in a nutshell, is bitcoin explained.\n\nBitcoin creates the potential for an open financial system that is more efficient, more free, and more innovative.\nHow Bitcoin works\nUnlike credit card networks like Visa and payment processors like Paypal, bitcoin is not owned by an individual or company. Bitcoin is the world\u2019s first completely open payment network which anyone with an internet connection can participate in. Bitcoin was designed to be used on the internet, and doesn\u2019t depend on banks or private companies to process transactions.\nOne of the most important elements of Bitcoin is the blockchain, which tracks who owns what, similar to how a bank tracks assets. What sets the Bitcoin blockchain apart from a bank's ledger is that it is decentralized, meaning anyone can view it and no single entity controls it.\nHere are some details about how it all works:\nSpecialized computers known as \u2018mining rigs\u2019 perform the equations required to verify and record a new transaction. In the early days, a typical desktop PC was powerful enough to participate, which allowed pretty much anyone who was curious to try their hand at mining. These days the computers required are massive, specialized, and often owned by businesses or large numbers of individuals pooling their resources. (In October 2019, it required 12 trillion times more computing power to mine one bitcoin than it did when Nakamoto mined the first blocks in January 2009.)\n\nThe miners\u2019 collective computing power is used to ensure the accuracy of the ever-growing ledger. Bitcoin is inextricably tied to the blockchain; each new bitcoin is recorded on it, as is each subsequent transaction with all existing coins.\nHow does the network motivate miners to participate in the constant, essential work of maintaining the blockchain\u2014verifying transactions? The Bitcoin network holds a continuous lottery in which all the mining rigs around the world race to be the first to solve a math problem. Every 10 min or so, a winner is found, and the winner updates the Bitcoin ledger with new valid transactions. The prize changes over time, but in May 2020, the reward for each winner of this raffle went from 12.5 bitcoin per block to 6.25, and in 2024, with the halving, this reward further dropped from 6.25 to 3.125 as a mechanism to increase scarcity.\nAt the beginning, a bitcoin was technically worthless. At the end of 2019, it was trading at around $7,500, and in November 2021, it topped $64,000. As bitcoin\u2019s value has risen, its easy divisibility (the ability to buy a small fraction of one bitcoin) has become a key attribute. One bitcoin is currently divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin); the bitcoin community refers to the smallest unit as a \u2018Satoshi.\u2019\nNakamoto set the network up so that the number of bitcoin will never exceed 21 million, ensuring scarcity. As of December 2023, there were around 1,4 million bitcoins still available to be mined. The last blocks will theoretically be mined in 2140.\n\nCryptocurrencies and traditional currencies share some traits \u2014 like how you can use them to buy things or how you can transfer them electronically \u2014 but they\u2019re also different in interesting ways. Here are a few highlights.\nBitcoin is the world\u2019s first completely open payment network which anyone with an internet connection can participate in.\nKey question\nHow does bitcoin have value?\nEssentially the same way a traditional currency does \u2013 because it\u2019s proven itself to be a viable and convenient way to store value, which means it can easily be traded for goods, services, or other assets. It\u2019s scarce, secure, portable (compared to, say, gold), and easily divisible, allowing transactions of all sizes.\n\nHow to get Bitcoin\nThe easiest way to buy bitcoin is to purchase it through an online exchange like Coinbase. Coinbase makes it easy to buy, sell, send, receive, and store bitcoin without needing to hold it yourself using something called public and private keys.\nHow to buy bitcoin, with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong\nHowever, if you choose to buy and store bitcoin outside of an online exchange, here\u2019s how that works.\nEach person who joins the bitcoin network is issued a public key, which is a long string of letters and numbers that you can think of like an email address, and a private key, which is equivalent to a password.\nWhen you buy bitcoin\u2014or send/receive it\u2014you get a public key, which you can think of as a key that unlocks a virtual vault and gives you access to your money.\nAnyone can send bitcoin to you via your public key, but only the holder of the private key can access the bitcoin in the \u201cvirtual vault\u201d once it\u2019s been sent.\nThere are many ways to store bitcoin both online and off. The simplest solution is a virtual wallet.\nIf you want to transfer money from your wallet to a bank account after selling your bitcoin, the Coinbase app makes it as easy as transferring funds from one bank to another. Similar to conventional bank transfers or ATM withdrawals, exchanges like Coinbase set a daily limit, and it may take between a few days and a week for the transaction to be completed.\nThe easiest way to buy bitcoin is to purchase it through an online exchange like Coinbase.\nKey question\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain?\nAll bitcoin transactions and public keys are recorded on a virtual ledger called the blockchain. The ledger is effectively a chronological list of transactions. This ledger is copied\u2014exactly\u2014across every computer that is connected to the bitcoin network, and it is constantly checked and secured using a vast amount of computing power across the globe. The blockchain concept has turned out to be powerful and adaptable, and there are now a wide variety of non-cryptocurrency-related blockchains that are used for things like supply-chain management. The \u2018Bitcoin Blockchain\u2019 specifically refers to the virtual ledger that records bitcoin transactions and private keys.\nHow to use Bitcoin\nBack in 2013, a bitcoin enthusiast named Laszlo Hanyecz created a message-board post offering 10,000 BTC \u2013 which then was worth around $25 \u2013 to anyone who would deliver two pizzas to his Jacksonville, Florida, home. As the legend goes, those two pizzas, which another bitcoin early-adopter bought from a local Papa John\u2019s, marked the first successful purchase of non-virtual goods using bitcoin. Thankfully it\u2019s a lot easier to use bitcoin these days!\nIt\u2019s simple: Transactions using BTC aren\u2019t that different from those using a credit or debit card, but instead of being asked to enter card info, you\u2019ll simply be entering the payment amount and the vendor\u2019s public key (similar to an email address) via a wallet app. (When transacting in person using smartphones or tablets, often a QR code will pop up to simplify the process \u2013 when you scan the code, your wallet app will automatically enter the pertinent information.)\nIt\u2019s private: One of the benefits of paying with bitcoin is that doing so limits the amount of personal information you need to provide. The only time you need to share your name and address is if you\u2019re purchasing physical goods that need to be shipped.\nIt\u2019s flexible: As to what you should do with your bitcoin, that depends completely on your personal interests. Here are some ideas:\nYou can sell it for cash using an exchange or a Bitcoin ATM.\nYou can spend it online or in brick-and-mortar retailers as you would any other currency by using a Bitcoin debit card.\nYou can hold on to some or all of it as part of your investment and savings strategy.\nYou might choose to that is close to your heart (check out).\nAnd if you have a serious budget and unfulfilled astronaut dreams? Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic happily accepts BTC in exchange for the opportunity to blast off on one of its forthcoming space-tourism missions.\nDue to the cryptographic nature of the Bitcoin network, bitcoin payments are fundamentally more secure than standard debit/credit card transactions.\nWhat makes Bitcoin a new kind of money?\nBitcoin is global. You can send it across the planet as easily as you can pay with cash in the physical world. It isn't closed on weekends, doesn\u2019t charge you a fee to access your money, and doesn't impose any arbitrary limits.\nBitcoin is irreversible. Bitcoin is like cash, in the sense that transactions cannot be reversed by the sender. In comparison, credit cards, conventional online payment systems, and banking transactions can be reversed after the payment has been made\u2014sometimes months after the initial transaction\u2014due to the centralized intermediaries that complete the transactions. This creates higher fraud risk for merchants, which can lead to higher fees for using credit cards.\nBitcoin is private. When paying with bitcoin, there are no bank statements, or any need to provide unnecessary personal information to the merchant. Bitcoin transactions don\u2019t contain any identifying information other than the bitcoin addresses and amounts involved.\nBitcoin is secure. Due to the cryptographic nature of the Bitcoin network, bitcoin payments are fundamentally more secure than standard debit/credit card transactions. When making a bitcoin payment, no sensitive information is required to be sent over the internet. There is a very low risk of your financial information being compromised, or having your identity stolen.\nBitcoin is open. Every transaction on the Bitcoin network is published publicly, without exception. This means there's no room for manipulation of transactions (save for a highly unlikely 51% attack scenario) or changing the supply of bitcoin. The software that constitutes the core of Bitcoin is free and open-source so anyone can review the code.\nBitcoin is safe. In more than ten years of existence, the bitcoin network has never been successfully hacked. And because the system is permissionless and open-sourced, countless computer scientists and cryptographers have been able to examine all aspects of the network and its security.\nWhere does Bitcoin come from?\nBitcoin is virtually \u2018mined\u2019 by a vast, decentralized (also referred to as \u2018peer-to-peer\u2019) network of computers that are constantly verifying and securing the accuracy of the blockchain. Every single bitcoin transaction is reflected on that ledger, with new information periodically gathered together in a \u201cblock,\u201d which is added to all the blocks that came before."

    "original_text": "Defining Ether and Ethereum\nCreated in 2015, Ether is known as the fuel for operating the Ethereum platform.  Ether, like other digital currencies, can be used to pay for goods and services. But it is also used to support the development of applications on the Ethereum network.\nOftentimes, the word Ethereum is used to represent both the network as well as Ether.\nTo better understand the uses of Ether, let\u2019s first look at the Ethereum platform.\nEthereum\nEthereum is an open-ended, decentralized, blockchain-based, public software platform that facilitates peer-to-peer contracts, known as Smart Contracts, as well as Decentralized Applications, known as DApps.\nSmart contracts allow users to exchange value without requiring an intermediary.  Smart contracts are agreements with defined terms and protocols in place to enforce them.\nBut unlike traditional contracts, written in human languages and enforced by courts of law, smart contracts are written in code that a computer can execute, which eliminates ambiguity.\nThe Ethereum network acts as a single decentralized computer that runs the smart contract code. This means that all computers participating in the Ethereum network will come to consensus on the outcome of each smart contract.\nTraditional software applications often rely on central authorities to store data and perform operations on that data. This requires trust in the central authority.\nDApps can make use of smart contracts on the Ethereum network to achieve decentralization. Smart contracts can store data. The Ethereum network enforces that all operations on the data happen according to the smart contract code. In other words, the data maintains its integrity without a central trusted party.\nEther\nIn order to support the Ethereum network, developers need the cryptocurrency, Ether, to create and run applications. Ether is used to pay for transaction fees and computational services. \nUsers can send Ether to other users, and developers can write smart contracts that receive, hold, and send Ether.\nEther comes into existence by the validation of transactions on the Ethereum platform, through a process called mining.  Those performing this validation are referred to as \u201cminers\u201d.\nWhen miners successfully verify a group of transactions, they are awarded Ether.  Miners follow a set of cryptographic rules which keep the network stable, safe and secure. \nEther transactions are recorded and verified on a digital public ledger called blockchain. \nHOW DO YOU OBTAIN ETHER?\nThere are multiple ways for an individual to obtain Ether.\nIt can be purchased on an exchange using a fiat currency under the symbol ETH.\nIt can be exchanged for Bitcoin on exchanges that offer a BTC-ETH pair.\nIt can be transferred to you from another person or entity.\nIt can be earned as a miner, through joining a mining pool or by purchasing a cloud mining contract\nETHEREUM WALLETS\nBefore taking possession of Ether, an individual must have an Ethereum wallet. \nSecure Ethereum wallets can be downloaded and set up onto a computer, smartphone or other mobile device. \nEach Ethereum wallet stores an individual\u2019s private key which allows the wallet owner to sign transactions that send Ether to other parties.\nWHY WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN OWNING ETHER?\nAs previously mentioned, Ether is needed by developers to create Smart Contracts and DApps on the Ethereum network.\nAdditionally, Ether can be used as an investment whose value can go up or down.  It can be owned or used as a tradable instrument.\nEther is a critical component to keeping the Ethereum platform growing and evolving in the digital asset environment."

    "original_text": "What is Cryptocurrency and how does it work?\n\nCryptocurrency \u2013 meaning and definition\nCryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuing or regulating authority, instead using a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\nCryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It\u2019s a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.\nCryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.\nThe first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was founded in 2009 and remains the best known today. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.\nHow does cryptocurrency work?\nCryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders.\nUnits of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets.\nIf you own cryptocurrency, you don\u2019t own anything tangible. What you own is a key that allows you to move a record or a unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party.\nAlthough Bitcoin has been around since 2009, cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain technology are still emerging in financial terms, and more uses are expected in the future. Transactions including bonds, stocks, and other financial assets could eventually be traded using the technology.\nCryptocurrency examples\nThere are thousands of cryptocurrencies. Some of the best known include:\nBitcoin:\nFounded in 2009, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the most commonly traded. The currency was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 widely believed to be a pseudonym for an individual or group of people whose precise identity remains unknown.\nEthereum:\nDeveloped in 2015, Ethereum is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH) or Ethereum. It is the most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.\nLitecoin:\nThis currency is most similar to bitcoin but has moved more quickly to develop new innovations, including faster payments and processes to allow more transactions.\nRipple:\nRipple is a distributed ledger system that was founded in 2012. Ripple can be used to track different kinds of transactions, not just cryptocurrency. The company behind it has worked with various banks and financial institutions.\nNon-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies are collectively known as \u201caltcoins\u201d to distinguish them from the original.\nHow to buy cryptocurrency\nYou may be wondering how to buy cryptocurrency safely. There are typically three steps involved. These are:\nStep 1: Choosing a platform\nThe first step is deciding which platform to use. Generally, you can choose between a traditional broker or dedicated cryptocurrency exchange:\nTraditional brokers. These are online brokers who offer ways to buy and sell cryptocurrency, as well as other financial assets like stocks, bonds, and ETFs. These platforms tend to offer lower trading costs but fewer crypto features.\nCryptocurrency exchanges. There are many cryptocurrency exchanges to choose from, each offering different cryptocurrencies, wallet storage, interest-bearing account options, and more. Many exchanges charge asset-based fees.\nWhen comparing different platforms, consider which cryptocurrencies are on offer, what fees they charge, their security features, storage and withdrawal options, and any educational resources.\nStep 2: Funding your account\nOnce you have chosen your platform, the next step is to fund your account so you can begin trading. Most crypto exchanges allow users to purchase crypto using fiat (i.e., government-issued) currencies such as the US Dollar, the British Pound, or the Euro using their debit or credit cards \u2013 although this varies by platform.\nCrypto purchases with credit cards are considered risky, and some exchanges don't support them. Some credit card companies don't allow crypto transactions either. This is because cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and it is not advisable to risk going into debt \u2014 or potentially paying high credit card transaction fees \u2014 for certain assets.\nSome platforms will also accept ACH transfers and wire transfers. The accepted payment methods and time taken for deposits or withdrawals differ per platform. Equally, the time taken for deposits to clear varies by payment method.\nAn important factor to consider is fees. These include potential deposit and withdrawal transaction fees plus trading fees. Fees will vary by payment method and platform, which is something to research at the outset.\nStep 3: Placing an order\nYou can place an order via your broker's or exchange's web or mobile platform. If you are planning to buy cryptocurrencies, you can do so by selecting \"buy,\" choosing the order type, entering the amount of cryptocurrencies you want to purchase, and confirming the order. The same process applies to \"sell\" orders.\nThere are also other ways to invest in crypto. These include payment services like PayPal, Cash App, and Venmo, which allow users to buy, sell, or hold cryptocurrencies. In addition, there are the following investment vehicles:\nBitcoin trusts: You can buy shares of Bitcoin trusts with a regular brokerage account. These vehicles give retail investors exposure to crypto through the stock market. \nBitcoin mutual funds: There are Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin mutual funds to choose from. \nBlockchain stocks or ETFs: You can also indirectly invest in crypto through blockchain companies that specialize in the technology behind crypto and crypto transactions. Alternatively, you can buy stocks or ETFs of companies that use blockchain technology.\nThe best option for you will depend on your investment goals and risk appetite.\nHow to store cryptocurrency\nOnce you have purchased cryptocurrency, you need to store it safely to protect it from hacks or theft. Usually, cryptocurrency is stored in crypto wallets, which are physical devices or online software used to store the private keys to your cryptocurrencies securely. Some exchanges provide wallet services, making it easy for you to store directly through the platform. However, not all exchanges or brokers automatically provide wallet services for you.\nThere are different wallet providers to choose from. The terms \u201chot wallet\u201d and \u201ccold wallet\u201d are used:\nHot wallet storage: \"hot wallets\" refer to crypto storage that uses online software to protect the private keys to your assets.\nCold wallet storage: Unlike hot wallets, cold wallets (also known as hardware wallets) rely on offline electronic devices to securely store your private keys.\nTypically, cold wallets tend to charge fees, while hot wallets don't.\n\nWhat can you buy with cryptocurrency?\nWhen it was first launched, Bitcoin was intended to be a medium for daily transactions, making it possible to buy everything from a cup of coffee to a computer or even big-ticket items like real estate. That hasn\u2019t quite materialized and, while the number of institutions accepting cryptocurrencies is growing, large transactions involving it are rare. Even so, it is possible to buy a wide variety of products from e-commerce websites using crypto. Here are some examples:\nTechnology and e-commerce sites:\nSeveral companies that sell tech products accept crypto on their websites, such as newegg.com, AT&T, and Microsoft. Overstock, an e-commerce platform, was among the first sites to accept Bitcoin. Shopify, Rakuten, and Home Depot also accept it.\nLuxury goods:\nSome luxury retailers accept crypto as a form of payment. For example, online luxury retailer Bitdials offers Rolex, Patek Philippe, and other high-end watches in return for Bitcoin.\nCars:\nSome car dealers \u2013 from mass-market brands to high-end luxury dealers \u2013 already accept cryptocurrency as payment.\nInsurance:\nIn April 2021, Swiss insurer AXA announced that it had begun accepting Bitcoin as a mode of payment for all its lines of insurance except life insurance (due to regulatory issues). Premier Shield Insurance, which sells home and auto insurance policies in the US, also accepts Bitcoin for premium payments.\nIf you want to spend cryptocurrency at a retailer that doesn\u2019t accept it directly, you can use a cryptocurrency debit card, such as BitPay in the US.\nStay Safe While Exploring Cryptocurrency\nKaspersky Premium protects you from phishing sites and crypto scams. Secure your investments with real-time threat detection.\nTry Premium for Free\nCryptocurrency fraud and cryptocurrency scams\nUnfortunately, cryptocurrency crime is on the rise. Cryptocurrency scams include:\nFake websites: Bogus sites which feature fake testimonials and crypto jargon promising massive, guaranteed returns, provided you keep investing.\nVirtual Ponzi schemes: Cryptocurrency criminals promote non-existent opportunities to invest in digital currencies and create the illusion of huge returns by paying off old investors with new investors\u2019 money. One scam operation, BitClub Network, raised more than $700 million before its perpetrators were indicted in December 2019.\n\"Celebrity\" endorsements: Scammers pose online as billionaires or well-known names who promise to multiply your investment in a virtual currency but instead steal what you send. They may also use messaging apps or chat rooms to start rumours that a famous businessperson is backing a specific cryptocurrency. Once they have encouraged investors to buy and driven up the price, the scammers sell their stake, and the currency reduces in value.\nRomance scams: The FBI warns of a trend in online dating scams, where tricksters persuade people they meet on dating apps or social media to invest or trade in virtual currencies. The FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Centre fielded more than 1,800 reports of crypto-focused romance scams in the first seven months of 2021, with losses reaching $133 million.\nOtherwise, fraudsters may pose as legitimate virtual currency traders or set up bogus exchanges to trick people into giving them money. Another crypto scam involves fraudulent sales pitches for individual retirement accounts in cryptocurrencies. Then there is straightforward cryptocurrency hacking, where criminals break into the digital wallets where people store their virtual currency to steal it.\n\nIs cryptocurrency safe?\nCryptocurrencies are usually built using blockchain technology. Blockchain describes the way transactions are recorded into \"blocks\" and time stamped. It's a fairly complex, technical process, but the result is a digital ledger of cryptocurrency transactions that's hard for hackers to tamper with.\nIn addition, transactions require a two-factor authentication process. For instance, you might be asked to enter a username and password to start a transaction. Then, you might have to enter an authentication code sent via text to your personal cell phone.\nWhile securities are in place, that does not mean cryptocurrencies are un-hackable. Several high-dollar hacks have cost cryptocurrency start-ups heavily. Hackers hit Coincheck to the tune of $534 million and BitGrail for $195 million, making them two of the biggest cryptocurrency hacks of 2018.\nUnlike government-backed money, the value of virtual currencies is driven entirely by supply and demand. This can create wild swings that produce significant gains for investors or big losses. And cryptocurrency investments are subject to far less regulatory protection than traditional financial products like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.\nFour tips to invest in cryptocurrency safely\nAccording to Consumer Reports, all investments carry risk, but some experts consider cryptocurrency to be one of the riskier investment choices out there. If you are planning to invest in cryptocurrencies, these tips can help you make educated choices.\nResearch exchanges:\nBefore you invest, learn about cryptocurrency exchanges. It\u2019s estimated that there are over 500 exchanges to choose from. Do your research, read reviews, and talk with more experienced investors before moving forward.\nKnow how to store your digital currency:\nIf you buy cryptocurrency, you have to store it. You can keep it on an exchange or in a digital wallet. While there are different kinds of wallets, each has its benefits, technical requirements, and security. As with exchanges, you should investigate your storage choices before investing.\nDiversify your investments:\nDiversification is key to any good investment strategy, and this holds true when you are investing in cryptocurrency. Don't put all your money in Bitcoin, for example, just because that's the name you know. There are thousands of options, and it's better to spread your investment across several currencies.\nPrepare for volatility:\nThe cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, so be prepared for ups and downs. You will see dramatic swings in prices. If your investment portfolio or mental wellbeing can't handle that, cryptocurrency might not be a wise choice for you.\nCryptocurrency is all the rage right now, but remember, it is still in its relative infancy and is considered highly speculative. Investing in something new comes with challenges, so be prepared. If you plan to participate, do your research, and invest conservatively to start.\nOne of the best ways you can stay safe online is by using a comprehensive antivirus. Kaspersky Internet Security defends you from malware infections, spyware, data theft and protects your online payments using bank-grade encryption."

    "original_text": "Cryptocurrency Basics: Pros, Cons and How It Works\nCryptocurrency (or \u201ccrypto\u201d) is a digital currency that can be used to buy goods and services or traded for a profit. Bitcoin is the most widely used cryptocurrency.\n\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\nCryptocurrency (or \u201ccrypto\u201d) is a digital currency, such as Bitcoin, that is used as an alternative payment method or speculative investment. Cryptocurrencies get their name from the cryptographic techniques that let people spend them securely without the need for a central government or bank.\nHere are a few examples:\nBitcoin was initially developed primarily to be a form of payment that isn't controlled or distributed by a central bank. While financial institutions have traditionally been necessary to verify that a payment has been processed successfully, Bitcoin accomplishes this securely, without that central authority.\nEthereum uses the same underlying technology as Bitcoin, but instead of strictly peer-to-peer payments, the cryptocurrency is used to pay for transactions on the Ethereum network. This network, built on the Ethereum blockchain, enables entire financial ecosystems to operate without a central authority. To visualize this, think insurance without the insurance company, or real estate titling without the title company.\nScores of altcoins (broadly defined as any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin) arose to capitalize on the various \u2014 and at times promising \u2014 use cases for blockchain technology.\nMeme coins, a subcategory of altcoins, are joke cryptocurrencies that represent internet memes. Some meme coins, such as Dogecoin, have risen to substantial market caps, despite having no serious use cases.\n\nWhy do people invest in cryptocurrencies?\nPeople invest in cryptocurrencies for the same reason anyone invests in anything. They hope its value will rise, netting them a profit.\nIf demand for Bitcoin grows, for example, the interplay of supply and demand could push up its value. If people began using Bitcoin for payments on a huge scale, demand for Bitcoin would go up, and in turn, its price in dollars would increase. So, if you'd purchased one Bitcoin before that increase in demand, you could theoretically sell that one Bitcoin for more U.S. dollars than you bought it for, making a profit.\nThe same principles apply to Ethereum. \"Ether\" is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, where developers can build decentralized finance (or \"DeFi\") apps without the need for a third-party financial institution. Developers must use Ether to build and run applications on Ethereum, so theoretically, the more that is built on the Ethereum blockchain, the higher the demand for Ether.\nHowever, it's important to note that to some, cryptocurrencies aren't investments at all. Bitcoin enthusiasts, for example, hail it as a much-improved monetary system over our current one and would prefer we spend and accept it as everyday payment. One common refrain \u2014 \"one Bitcoin is one Bitcoin\" \u2014 underscores the view that Bitcoin shouldn't be measured in USD, but rather by the value it brings as a new monetary system.\nHow does cryptocurrency work?\nCryptocurrencies are supported by a technology known as blockchain, which maintains a tamper-resistant record of transactions and keeps track of who owns what. The use of blockchains addressed a problem faced by previous efforts to create purely digital currencies: preventing people from making copies of their holdings and attempting to spend it twice.\nIndividual units of cryptocurrencies can be referred to as coins or tokens, depending on how they are used. Some are intended to be units of exchange for goods and services, others are stores of value, and some can be used to participate in specific software programs such as games and financial products.\nHow are cryptocurrencies created?\nOne common way cryptocurrencies are created is through a process known as mining, which is used by Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining can be an energy-intensive process in which computers solve complex puzzles in order to verify the authenticity of transactions on the network. As a reward, the owners of those computers can receive newly created cryptocurrency. Other cryptocurrencies use different methods, such as proof of stake, to create and distribute tokens, and many have a significantly lighter environmental impact.\nFor most people, the easiest way to get cryptocurrency is to buy it, either from an exchange or another user.\nWhy are there so many kinds of cryptocurrency?\nIt\u2019s important to remember that Bitcoin is different from cryptocurrency in general. While Bitcoin is the first and most valuable cryptocurrency, the market is large \u2014 there are thousands of cryptocurrencies. And while some cryptocurrencies have total market valuations in the hundreds of billions of dollars, others are obscure and essentially worthless.\nIf you\u2019re thinking about getting into cryptocurrency, it can be helpful to start with one that is commonly traded and relatively well-established in the market. These coins typically have the largest market capitalizations.\nThoughtfully selecting your cryptocurrency, however, is no guarantee of success in such a volatile space. Sometimes, an issue in the deeply interconnected crypto industry can spill out and have broad implications on asset values. For example, when crypto exchange FTX collapsed in November 2022, the price of Bitcoin fell more than 20% over the following two months.\nAre cryptocurrencies financial securities, like stocks?\nWhether or not cryptocurrency is a security is a bit of a gray area right now. To back up a little, generally, a \"security\" in finance is anything that represents a value and can be traded. Stocks are securities because they represent ownership in a public company. Bonds are securities because they represent a debt owed to the bondholder. And both of these securities can be traded on public markets.\n\nRegulators have increasingly signaled that cryptocurrencies should be regulated similarly to other securities, such as stocks and bonds. However, with the June 2024 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo Supreme Court ruling, that may change \u2014 Congress may have to clearly define crypto regulation through law making rather than allowing the SEC to enforce rules based on its interpretation. That could have major implications for the asset class in the future.\nPros and cons of cryptocurrency\nCryptocurrency inspires passionate opinions across the spectrum of investors. Here are a few reasons that some people believe it is a transformational technology, while others worry it's a fad.\nCryptocurrency pros\nCryptocurrency is a volatile investment, but in the long term, many coins have risen in value considerably. Bitcoin's price has increased roughly tenfold over the last five years, despite several bull and bear markets over that time. It topped $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, and though it fell significantly in the months after that, once again surpassed the psychologically-important $100,000 level again on May 8, 2025. By May 22, it had hit yet another all-time high of $111,000.\nSome supporters like the fact that cryptocurrency removes central banks from managing the money supply since over time these banks tend to reduce the value of money via inflation.\nIn communities that have been underserved by the traditional financial system, some people see cryptocurrencies as a promising foothold. Pew Research Center data from 2021 found that Asian, Black and Hispanic people \"are more likely than White adults to say they have ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency\n[2]\n.\"\nOther advocates like the blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies, because it\u2019s a decentralized processing and recording system and can be more secure than traditional payment systems. It may also provide a cheaper way to send money internationally; although crypto networks typically charge transaction fees, many traditional international money transfer services charge substantial fees themselves.\nSome cryptocurrencies offer their owners the opportunity to earn passive income through a process called staking. Crypto staking involves using your cryptocurrencies to help verify transactions on a blockchain protocol. Though staking has its risks, it can allow you to grow your crypto holdings without buying more.\nCryptocurrency cons\nMany cryptocurrency projects are untested, and blockchain technology in general has yet to gain wide adoption. If the underlying idea behind cryptocurrency does not reach its potential, long-term investors may never see the returns they hoped for.\nFor shorter-term crypto investors, there are other risks. Its prices tend to change rapidly, and while that means that many people have made money quickly by buying in at the right time, many others have lost money by doing so just before a crypto crash.\nThose wild shifts in value may also cut against the basic ideas behind the projects that cryptocurrencies were created to support. For example, people may be less likely to use Bitcoin as a payment system if they are not sure what it will be worth the next day.\nThe environmental impact of Bitcoin and other projects that use similar mining protocols is significant. A comparison by the University of Cambridge, for instance, said worldwide Bitcoin mining consumes more than twice as much power as all U.S. residential lightin. Some cryptocurrencies use different technology that demands less energy.\nGovernments around the world have not yet fully reckoned with how to handle cryptocurrency, so regulatory changes and crackdowns have the potential to affect the market in unpredictable ways.\nMany cryptocurrency networks charge a fee for any transaction, including buying or selling crypto as an investor. These can vary wildly, and high fees can cut into returns. Bitcoin transaction fees, for example, have varied between less than 50 cents and more than $100 per transaction over the last year, during periods of exceptionally low or high transaction activity.\nCryptocurrency legal and tax issues\nThere\u2019s no question that cryptocurrencies are legal in the U.S. Ultimately whether they\u2019re legal worldwide depends on each individual country.\nThe question of whether cryptocurrencies are legally allowed, however, is only one part of the legal question. Other things to consider include how crypto is taxed and what you can buy with cryptocurrency.\nLegal tender: You might call them cryptocurrencies, but they differ from traditional currencies in one important way: there's no requirement in most places that they be accepted as \"legal tender.\" The U.S. dollar, by contrast, must be accepted for \"all debts, public and private.\" Countries around the world are taking various approaches to cryptocurrency. For now, only one country, El Salvador, accepts Bitcoin as legal tender. In the U.S., what you can buy with cryptocurrency depends on the preferences of the seller.\nCrypto taxes: Again, the term \"currency\" is a bit of a red herring when it comes to taxes in the U.S. Cryptocurrencies are taxed as property, rather than currency. That means that when you sell them, you'll pay tax on the capital gains, or the difference between the price of the purchase and sale. And if you're given crypto as payment \u2014 or as a reward for an activity such as mining \u2014 you'll be taxed on the value at the time you received them.\nYour decision: Is cryptocurrency a good investment?\nCryptocurrency is a relatively risky investment, no matter which way you slice it. Generally speaking, high-risk investments should make up a small part of your overall portfolio \u2014 one common guideline is no more than 10%. You may want to look first to shore up your retirement savings, pay off debt or invest in less-volatile funds made up of stocks and bonds.\nThere are other ways to manage risk within your crypto portfolio, such as by diversifying the range of cryptocurrencies that you buy. Crypto assets may rise and fall at different rates, and over different time periods, so by investing in several different products you can insulate yourself \u2014 to some degree \u2014 from losses in one of your holdings.\nPerhaps the most important thing when investing in anything is to do your homework. This is particularly important when it comes to cryptocurrencies, which are often linked to a specific technological product that is being developed or rolled out. When you buy a stock, it is linked to a company that is subject to well-defined financial reporting requirements, which can give you a sense of its prospects.\nWith cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, discerning which projects are viable can be more challenging. If you have a financial advisor who is familiar with cryptocurrency, it may be worth asking for input.\nFor beginning investors, it can also be worthwhile to examine how widely a cryptocurrency is being used. Most reputable crypto projects have publicly available metrics showing data such as how many transactions are being carried out on their platforms. If use of a cryptocurrency is growing, that may be a sign that it is establishing itself in the market. Cryptocurrencies also generally make \"white papers\" available to explain how they'll work and how they intend to distribute tokens.\nIf you're looking to invest in less established crypto products, here are some additional questions to consider:\nWho\u2019s heading the project? An identifiable and well-known leader is a positive sign.\nAre there other major investors who are investing in it? It\u2019s a good sign if other well-known investors want a piece of the currency.\nWill you own a portion in the company or just currency or tokens? This distinction is important. Being a part owner means you get to participate in its earnings (you\u2019re an owner), while buying tokens simply means you're entitled to use them, like chips in a casino.\nIs the currency already developed, or is the company looking to raise money to develop it? The further along the product, the less risky it is.\nIt can take a lot of work to comb through a prospectus; the more detail it has, the better your chances it\u2019s legitimate. But even legitimacy doesn\u2019t mean the currency will succeed. That\u2019s an entirely separate question, and that requires a lot of market savvy. Be sure to consider how to protect yourself from fraudsters who see cryptocurrencies as an opportunity to bilk investors."

    "original_text": "Cryptocurrency Market Cap Explained\n\nOn December 18 2024, the total cryptocurrency market capitalisation surpassed a whopping US$3.7 trillion. That remains the all time high for the asset class which has only existed for approximately 15 years.\nYes, that\u2019s a huge number. But without the context, what does it really mean? Is it an indicator of any historical trend, growth potential, or actual dollar amount?\nLet\u2019s dive into the most commonly touted crypto statistic: market cap. We\u2019ll discuss what it really means, how it\u2019s calculated, and how this metric could help you make decisions on future crypto investments.\nDefinition:\nWhat is Market Cap in Crypto?\nHow is Market Cap Calculated?\nDifference Between Small, Mid, & Large-Cap Cryptocurrencies\nMarket Cap vs. Cash Inflow\nOther Metrics & Ways to Evaluate Cryptocurrencies\nMarket Cap vs Volume\nTop 10 Cryptos by Market Cap**\nMarket Cap FAQs\nStart Building Your Crypto Portfolio with Caleb & Brown\nDefinition:\nIn the crypto market, market capitalisation (market cap) is the total dollar value of all coins in circulation. Market cap can be used to measure the value of a specific cryptocurrency, as well as refer to the total capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies in existence.\nWhat is Market Cap in Crypto?\nMarket cap is a metric used to help traders and investors understand the value or value potential of a particular cryptocurrency. It\u2019s a concept with roots in traditional investing, where market cap is used to quantify the dollar value of shares in circulation for a company. \nThe size of a market cap can help investors make inferences about the risk profile of a coin, its potential for long-term growth, and its market dominance.\nHow is Market Cap Calculated?\nThere are two common ways to express cryptocurrency market cap: circulating supply or fully diluted supply. Market cap can be calculated by using the number of coins currently in circulation (circulating supply). Or it can be calculated using the number of coins that will be in circulation once the limit is reached (full diluted supply). \nGiven that this serves mainly as a tool for making investment decisions in the present, circulating supply is almost exclusively used when calculating market cap. However, if you\u2019re set to be a long term holder it\u2019s worth considering the impacts of a fully diluted supply on your stake.\nMarket cap based on circulating supply is calculated with the following formula:\nCurrent Price x Circulating Supply = Market Cap\nDifference Between Small, Mid, & Large-Cap Cryptocurrencies\nWhen using market cap to discuss cryptocurrencies, they are generally divided into three categories: small, mid, and large-cap.\nSmall-cap cryptocurrencies\nSmall-cap cryptocurrencies tend to have market caps under $1 billion. Compared to other coins, they usually have less exchange support, lower volume, or both. For this reason, small market movements can create volatile swings for these small-cap cryptocurrencies.\nMid-cap cryptocurrencies\nMid-cap cryptocurrencies have capitalisations between $1 billion and $10 billion. Traders often look to mid-cap coins to predict growth potential. Yet since these cryptocurrencies haven\u2019t established large-cap positioning, there is still a greater level of risk involved.\nLarge-cap cryptocurrencies\nLarge-cap cryptocurrencies with capitalisations of more than $10 billion. These are your \u2018household name\u2019 coins; Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and more. These cryptocurrencies have a relatively higher trading volume compared to other crypto assets.\n\nWhy Are Large-Cap Cryptocurrencies Considered to Have Lower Risk Profile?\nIt goes without saying that cryptocurrency investments are more often than not more volatile than stocks or any other traditional investments. That said, investors see large-cap cryptos as stable investments within a volatile market. The large-cap coins which have shown growth over time (not overnight growth) usually have high liquidity, characteristics similar to the largest and long-standing publicly listed companies \u2013 stalwarts like General Motors, Ford and other multinational giants.\nSo if many investors decide to market and sell these larger assets at once, price and market cap drops will be smaller compared to a sell-off of small or mid-cap market assets.\nMarket Cap vs. Cash Inflow\nMarket cap and cash inflow are often confused because both are expressed in dollar amounts, but they represent very different concepts.\nMarket Cap is the total value of a cryptocurrency, calculated by multiplying the current price of one coin by the total number of coins in circulation. It\u2019s a snapshot of the coin\u2019s overall value, not the amount of money that has been invested or is currently in the market.\nCash Inflow, on the other hand, refers to the actual money being invested into the market\u2014new funds coming in to buy the cryptocurrency.\nMarket cap can change due to fluctuations in the coin\u2019s price, even if no new money is entering or leaving the market. For example, if the price of a coin goes up, the market cap increases, but this doesn\u2019t mean that more cash has been invested.\nIt\u2019s important to recognise that market cap is not a direct measure of cash inflow; it simply reflects the current value based on price changes and the total supply of coins.\nOther Metrics & Ways to Evaluate Cryptocurrencies\nWhile market cap is important, you should never use this number alone to evaluate a potential investment. Below is a list of other things to consider while doing your research.\nWhat is the project solving? i.e. Is there utility?\nDo the values of this project align with my values?\nWhat is the overall project ranking?\nRead the project white paper, is there anything about the project that seems questionable? (e.g. lack of real-world case use, issues with legality)\nPrice History\nLiquidity\nVolume\nFurther reading: The Bitcoin White Paper\nMarket Cap vs Volume\nThe relationship between market cap and volume can be speculative. Although one can influence the other in different ways, these influences aren\u2019t an exact science. \nIf a coin\u2019s 24-hour trading volume exceeds its market cap in a given period, it could mean investors are speculating about its potential growth. It could mean something, or it could be a temporary trend.\nConversely, Bitcoin has a low trading volume when compared to its market cap (still a high volume otherwise). But since there is less action happening, it doesn\u2019t mean that Bitcoin is losing value. We can probably infer that short-term holders (STHs) are becoming long-term holders (LTHs), reducing the overall liquid supply of Bitcoin. In other words the market is maturing, with lesser speculation at play.\nTop 10 Cryptos by Market Cap**\n(as of December 20, 2024)\nBitcoin (BTC)\nEthereum (ETH)\nXRP (XRP)\nTether (USDT)\nBNB (BNB)\nSolana (SOL)\nDogecoin (DOGE)\nUSDC (USDC)\nLido Staked Ether (STETH)\nCardano (ADA)\nMarket Cap FAQs\n(statistics up to date as of December 20, 2024)\nWhat is the current crypto market cap?\n$3,426,000,000,000\nWhy is crypto market cap important?\nIn a market fueled by social media trends, fear, and greed, market cap adds a level of objectivity to determining the value of a cryptocurrency.\nRecommended reading: What Is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index?\nWhat is the highest crypto market cap ever?\nThe total market cap reached an all-time high of $3.7 trillion on December 18, 2024.\nHow do you calculate crypto market cap?\nCurrent Price x Circulating Supply = Market Cap\nWhat is Bitcoin\u2019s market cap?\n$1,9,000,000,000\nWhat is Ethereum\u2019s market cap?*\n$396,000,000,000\nStart Building Your Crypto Portfolio with Caleb & Brown\nCaleb & Brown is the world's leading crypto brokerage for beginner and advanced investors alike, with hundreds of liquid assets readily available for your portfolio.\nOur personalised broker service makes crypto investing simple.

    "original_text": "A Beginner's Guide to Day Trading Crypto\nLearn all about day trading crypto with this detailed guide. Learn important strategies, tools, and tips to thrive in the dynamic cryptocurrency market.\nWhat Is Day Trading?\nDay trading is the business of trading assets within the same day to gain small profits from temporary price fluctuations. In the constantly evolving cryptocurrency world, it\u2019s a race against time and accuracy.\nSo, what sets day trading cryptocurrency apart? Well, unlike traditional markets that close after hours, the crypto market is open 24/7 for business \u2014 and tools like a crypto credit card can help traders earn crypto rewards on daily purchases while staying active in the market. This has the advantage of creating a virtually limitless list of trading opportunities for the traders \u2014 though it leaves them open to the significant risk of overtrading or losing steam. \nIt relies on the blockchain concept, which is trusted for decentralization as it brings about the transparency and security of the transactions.\nDay trading strategies are based on technical analysis, awareness of market sentiment, and keen perception of news that may affect volatility. While this kind of trading is not for everyone, people who like activity and actively engage in a fast-paced trading environment find it very rewarding.\nHow Much Can a Crypto Day Trader Make?\nThe earnings of a crypto day trader depend on skill, experience, and market conditions. While some traders boast daily profits of hundreds or even thousands of dollars, others also face steep losses.\nThere are a few key factors influencing profitability:\nVolatility: Coins like BTC and ETH often see significant price swings, creating profit opportunities. \nRisk Tolerance: Profitable traders set clear boundaries for acceptable losses and stick to them.\nScalping Frequency: High-frequency strategies like scalping can lead to small, consistent profits but require focus and discipline. \nCan Day Trading Make a Living?\nSome traders make a living through disciplined strategies, but it's not guaranteed. Beginners should focus on building skills and managing risks before relying on trading as a primary income source.\nIt's crucial to remember that day trading is not a guaranteed path to wealth. Successful traders invest in education, practice, and advanced tools to refine their strategies. \nHow To Start Day Trading Cryptocurrency\nStarting your journey as a crypto day trader requires preparation and a clear strategy \u2014 here\u2019s what to know to start your day trading journey: \nSet a Specific Time Frame\nIdentify your trading time frame based on your goals and availability. Popular intervals for day traders include 15-minute, 1-hour, and 4-hour charts. Shorter time frames help capture quick price movements, while longer ones allow for broader trend analysis.\nPerform Technical Analysis\nTechnical analysis is the backbone of day trading, and by learning to read candlestick charts and recognize patterns, traders can make data-driven decisions. Tools like moving averages and Bollinger Bands can help you identify trends and entry points.\nPractice Risk Management\nEffective risk management is key to long-term success. Use stop-loss orders to minimize potential losses and take-profit levels to lock in gains. Never risk more than 1-2% of your capital on a single trading day.\nAssess your comfort level with risk tolerance. High volatility can lead to rapid gains \u2014 or losses. Setting clear boundaries ensures you stay within your financial limits. \nIs Crypto Day Trading Worth it?\nDay trading cryptocurrency offers significant opportunities \u2014 but it isn't without challenges. Whether it\u2019s worth your time depends on your goals, risk tolerance, and commitment to learning.\nSome of the most attractive advantages of crypto day trading are:\nHigh-Profit Potential: Short-term strategies can generate quick returns.\nFlexibility: you can trade anytime, anywhere, making it suitable for remote work.\nHowever, day trading crypto can have a couple of potential downsides, too. For example, day trading requires significant focus and time. Plus, without discipline, the volatility that provides profits can also lead to losses.\nIf you\u2019re disciplined, well-informed, and equipped with a solid risk management strategy, day trading crypto can be a great rewarding venture.\nWhat Are the Best Indicators for Day Trading Cryptocurrency?\nSuccessful day traders rely on a variety of technical indicators to make informed decisions. Here are some of the key indicators for day trading:\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nRSI estimates the speed of value changes to distinguish overbought or oversold conditions. Divergence among RSI and price trends can demonstrate upcoming reversals.\nMoving Averages (MA)\nMoving averages track average prices over a specific time frame, revealing trends and price movements. The simple moving average (SMA) provides an average over time, while the exponential moving average (EMA) responds quicker to recent prices. Crossovers between short and long-term MAs are common signals for trend changes.\nMACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)\nMACD highlights trend reversals and momentum strength. Bullish signs occur when the MACD line crosses over the Signal Line, and bearish signals when it crosses below. Its histogram shows momentum strength, helping with timing entries and exits.\nVolume\nVolume measures trade activity, confirming trends and market sentiments. High volume during price movements supports trend strength, while low volume can signal weakness. It\u2019s also crucial for validating breakouts and distinguishing real moves from false signals.\nTo use indicators effectively, it\u2019s generally best to combine multiple indicators for the most holistic, well-rounded view. Try to match indicators with your time frame, too \u2014 for example, use RSI for short-term trades. \nWhat Should You Look For When Day Trading Crypto?\nWhen day trading, choosing the best crypto is critical. Focus on digital assets with high liquidity, significant price movements, and strong market sentiments.\nHigh Volatility\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are known for their rapid price fluctuations. This high volatility creates opportunities for profit within short periods. Traders also monitor the Solana price, as its volatility and growing ecosystem have made it a popular choice for short-term trading opportunities.\nHigh Liquidity\nAssets with high trading volume ensure the smooth execution of trades. High liquidity reduces slippage, which is crucial when entering or exciting positions quickly. \nMarket Cap\nLarge-cap cryptocurrencies are more stable and less prone to sudden drops. For beginners, these assets provide a safer entry point.\nMarket Sentiment\nStay updated on news and events that impact market sentiment. Social media trends, government regulations, and economic developments can all influence trader behavior.  \nResistance Levels\nIdentifying support and resistance levels helps pinpoint optimal entry and exit points, minimizing risk and maximizing returns.\nHow Does Market Sentiment Affect Crypto Day Trading?\nMarket sentiment, the collective mood of traders and investors, significantly impacts crypto day trading. Social media trends, news, and global events can quickly sway prices and trading volumes \u2014 for example, a tweet from an influential figure or news of regulatory changes can trigger rapid price shifts.\nLeveraging Social Media Trends\nPlatforms like Reddit and Twitter influence sentiment and traders can monitor trending hashtags and use sentiment analysis tools to gauge market tone.\nResponding to News and Events\nPositive news, such as corporate adoption, often drives prices up, while negative events, like regulatory crackdowns, can lead to sell-offs. Staying updated with reliable news sources helps traders act swiftly.\nTools for Sentiment Analysis \nCertain tools can help analyze social media trends, measuring metrics like engagement and sentiment scores to predict price movements. \nOn-chain analytics platforms can also provide deeper insights, such as tracking how much Bitcoin is moving into or out of exchanges, which can signal shifts in market sentiment. Using these tools together gives traders a clearer picture of how sentiment is likely to affect price action. \nWhile technical analysis focuses on price trends and patterns, sentiment analysis provides a human-centered perspective, allowing traders to anticipate emotional market reactions. Combining both approaches can lead to more informed and successful trading decisions.\nWhat Are Other Cryptocurrency Trading Strategies?\nDiversifying your approach with alternative strategies can improve overall performance.\nArbitrage\nBuy low on one exchange and sell high on another. Arbitrage exploits price differences across platforms, offering quick profits with minimal risk. It requires monitoring multiple exchanges simultaneously to act quickly when opportunities arise. \nScalping\nThis strategy focuses on small, frequent gains. Scalping requires quick execution and is best suited for assets with high liquidity and low fees. Traders often use short time frames, such as 1-minute or 5-minute charts, to maximize efficiency. \nRange Trading\nTrade within defined price ranges by identifying support and resistance zones. This method is ideal for stable market conditions. It works best when the market lacks a clear trend, making price movement more predictable. \nHODL (Buy and Hold)\nHold onto crypto assets despite short-term volatility. This long-term strategy emphasizes potential growth over time. Investors often use this strategy for coins they believe have strong future potential.\nFutures Trading\nSpeculate on future prices without owning the underlying asset. While this strategy offers leverage, it also comes with increased risk. \nIs Day Trading Crypto Legal?\nYes, day trading crypto is legal in most countries. However, the specifics of regulations can vary depending on where you live:\nCompliance: Many governments require traders to report capital gains from crypto trading. Ensure that you understand your local tax obligations.\nRegulations: Trusted platforms like Gemini, Binance, and Coinbase adhere to local and international laws, providing secure and legal trading environments.\nBans: Some nations have outright banned cryptocurrency trading (e.g., China), while others impose restrictions that limit trading activity.\nMake sure to research your country\u2019s cryptocurrency regulations, focusing on taxation and trading permissions. To avoid unsafe crypto trading, go for cryptocurrency exchanges that comply with the financial laws in your jurisdiction. It\u2019s also important to make sure you keep records of all trades, withdrawals, and deposits for tax filing purposes.\nIf you\u2019re trading in the crypto world, familiarizing yourself with the legal landscape is important \u2014 learning the rules early can guard against investment loss and peace of mind.\nThe Bottom Line\nDay trading crypto is an exciting but demanding pursuit \u2014 day trading can bring major rewards if you\u2019re willing to put time into learning. By paying attention to market trends and understanding your risk tolerance, you can approach the cryptocurrency market a bit more confidently.\nIf you know the tools and strategies and have committed to learning, then you can take challenges, convert them into opportunities, and do well in the crypto trading world.\nReady to get started?

    "original_text": "What is USDC (USDC)?\nKey takeaways \ud83d\udd11\nUSDC (USDC) is a stablecoin whose value is pegged to the US dollar.\nUSDC debuted in 2018 on the Ethereum blockchain, but is now available on many of the largest blockchains.\nThe Centre Consortium conceived USDC as an alternative to other popular US dollar backed stablecoins such as Tether (USDT), and focuses on creating transparency surrounding its USD backing.\nSummary of USDC \ud83d\udd0d\nUSDC (USDC) is an asset backed stablecoin whose value is pegged to the U.S. Dollar (USD). \nEvery USDC token in circulation is backed by $1 USD in cash or cash equivalents, such as short-term U.S. Treasury bonds held by regulated U.S. financial institutions. USDC has adopted the ERC-20 token standard, making it interoperable with all Ethereum-based applications. The token is now found on many other popular blockchains including Algorand, Solana and Tron. \nThe price predictability of USDC has allowed it to serve as a safe haven for cryptocurrency traders during periods of market volatility. USDC also enables a more efficient transaction of value in a stable digital currency across borders than has been the norm from traditional finance. \nUSDC\u2019s utility is underscored by its extensive ecosystem of holders and service providers such as decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto trading platforms.\n\n\nWho created USDC? \ud83d\udc64\nUSDC was first announced in May 2018 and launched in September the same year by Centre, a joint enterprise between peer-to-peer payment provider known as Circle and one of the largest crypto platforms in the world, Coinbase. \nCentre Consortium strives to provide the governance and standards required to build a digital financial ecosystem. USDC has aimed to improve the regulation, transparency and licensing standards of stablecoins when compared to other stablecoins available in the market today \u2014 namely Tether (USDT). \nThe project gained the attention of other large players in the financial sector as a result of the founding institutions\u2019 reputation and experience in the industry. USDC was initially backed by $110 million USD from Goldman Sachs and Breyer Capital, among other notable investors.\nBuy USDC\nHow does USDC work? \u2699\ufe0f\nUnlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, new USDC isn\u2019t released into circulation through the mining process. Instead, new USDC tokens are minted when users and businesses deposit United States government backed currency into their Circle account. A 1:1 representation of that asset, whose record of transactions is recorded and maintained using the efficiencies of blockchain technology, is created by exchanging USD for USDC. \nConversely, when USDC is deposited in exchange for USD, the tokens are burned to ensure the number in circulation matches the fiat amount held in reserve at all times.\nAt issuance, the equivalent amount of USD is held in cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries by Circle, ensuring that the value of USDC remains pegged with the value of USD. This means that unlike most cryptocurrencies that can fluctuate in value rapidly, USDC is designed to weather financial downturns with minimal volatility. \nThe one-for-one cash holdings that Circle uses to back their coin have allowed it to maintain a reliable peg to the U.S. Dollar, even during periods of extreme market volatility.\nWhile USDC had previously held small amounts of commercial paper, a type of short term debt issued by companies to cover their more immediate liabilities, the company has recently claimed to hold only government backed assets.\nAs a registered money service business in the U.S., Circle\u2019s holdings are audited by international accounting giant Grant Thornton.\nWhat are stablecoins?\nLearn about stablecoins and the important role they play in the crypto ecosystem.\nLearn about stablecoins\nWhy does USDC have value? \ud83e\udd14\nUSDC\u2019s stability makes it a reliable currency to use as a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account \u2014 the three qualities of money. This has allowed Circle to grow as a means of payment between individuals and corporations around the world.\nThose investing in cryptocurrencies, whose price can be subject to volatility, may also hold USDC while waiting for the prices of certain assets to stabilize.\nBusinesses accept payment in USDC due to its perceived safety and efficiency. USDC holders can transfer the currency throughout the world quickly, often making it a more viable option than traditional channels, such as bank transfers or money wires, for cross-border transactions. \nUSDC is also used to transact with a growing number of dApps to earn rewards by loaning or staking a user\u2019s holdings on platforms like AAVE.  Similar lending protocols across the decentralized finance ecosystem have allowed users to earn higher returns on their dollars than traditional bank savings accounts.\nWhy buy USDC? \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\nCrypto investors looking to hold their funds in a safe haven currency during periods of market volatility may find USDC valuable. Unlike other stablecoins which use a algorithm to maintain their peg to the U.S. Dollar, USDC is backed by verified, government backed reserves. \nUSDC holders will also find that their tokens can be used to pay for a variety of goods and services via an extensive ecosystem of dApps. USDC\u2019s stable peg also means purchasers and vendors can transact without fear of losing value after a sale has been made \u2014 a situation often experienced by those who transact with more volatile crypto assets.\nEarn USDC (USDC) rewards\nOpt in to earning rewards on your USDC with Kraken, so you can earn 5.5% annual percentage yield (APY) on your USDC."

    "original_text": "Trump family's net worth has increased by $2.9 billion thanks to crypto investments, new report says\nPresident Trump's venture into crypto products has increased his family's wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a new report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. \nThe group State Democracy Defenders Action estimated in a new report that the president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth \u2014 or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with the Trump family that launched in October 2024. State Democracy Defenders Action identifies itself as non-partisan, but it is overseen by frequent critics of President Trump, with an agenda focused on \"the autocratic threat to our nation.\"\nThe president's net worth is expected to get another bump, with World Liberty Financial's announcement this week that a Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in the Trump family-affiliated crypto fund. The Emirati firm, MGX, will purchase $2 billion in a stablecoin product offered by World Liberty, the company said in a statement to CBS. The currency, called \"USD1\" will then be used to invest in Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges.\nWorld Liberty has ties to the president and his sons. The fine print on the company's website says an entity affiliated with Mr. Trump and his family members own a 60% stake in the company.\nAccording to the company's public reports, a Trump family entity also holds 22.5 billion of the $WLF tokens \u2013- and takes an additional 75% in net revenue from future token purchases.\nDetails of the MGX deal have not been released, so it is unclear how much the Trump family stands to benefit from this transaction.\nIn a statement to CBS News, World Liberty said the deal represents the \"single largest-ever investment in a crypto company\" and sets a \"historic precedent.\" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment.\nThe White House responded to a request for comment by telling CBS News to \"report on something people actually care about.\" A spokesperson provided links to several White House technology initiatives.\nAs the president's investments in crypto have grown, the Securities and Exchange Commission has paused investigations into a dozen crypto companies since his inauguration, a CBS News analysis found.\n\n\n\"The bottom line is it appears like he's profiting off of his public office,\" said Virginia Canter, State Democracy Defenders chief counsel for ethics and anticorruption. Canter, who co-authored the new report, served as senior ethics counsel for the Treasury Department under both Republican and Democratic administrations. \n\"In terms of prior presidents in the modern age, they've all divested their assets, or they've rolled them over into what we call blind trusts,\" Canter said. \"President Trump did not do that in his first term, and it seems as if in the second term he's doubled down and he is all in (on) the crypto industry.\"\nThe report leans heavily on past media reports, including a Fortune magazine article that reviewed the Trump family's financial disclosures and provided the original estimates of the president's net worth.\nCrypto companies are not legally required to disclose who is buying and selling on their platforms to the public, so little is known about who has invested in Trump family-affiliated crypto products. \nCanter says this makes it more difficult to identify potential conflicts of interest. \n\"In his first administration, we could see who was walking in and out of the Trump hotels,\" she said.\nTrump hopes U.S. will be the \"crypto capital of the world\"\nThe president, who as recently as 2021 described crypto currency as a \"scam,\" has since embraced digital currency, saying he hopes to make the United States the \"crypto capital of the world.\"\nSince his inauguration, Mr. Trump has made several moves to unwind the regulatory environment that many industry insiders say crippled crypto businesses. \nHe has issued multiple executive orders to promote cryptocurrency, including one that seeks to promote the growth of digital currencies and another that instructed the Treasury Department to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. \nMr. Trump has also used his office to pardon the three founders of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, who pleaded guilty in 2022 to failing to prevent money laundering on their platform, according to a report by Reuters. \nThe value of Mr. Trump's crypto assets have at times fluctuated with his policy decisions and social media posts.\nThe value of $TRUMP increased 18.1% in early March after the president issued an executive order promoting a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, according to the report. A few weeks later, on March 23, the president posted \"I Love $TRUMP\u2013 SO COOL!! The Greatest of them all!!!!\" on Truth Social, which led to an increase in the price of the meme coin from $10.93 to $12.24.\nWhether or not the $TRUMP coin increases in value, the president's business collects trading fees when people buy or sell the coin. A Reuters analysis found that business entities behind the $TRUMP coin could have made nearly $100 million in fees in less than two weeks of trading.\nWorld Liberty Finance: The Trump family's crypto exchange\nAside from meme coins, the Trump family's more recent foray into cryptocurrency may become its most profitable. \nIn October, then-candidate Trump helped launch World Liberty Finance, a decentralized or \"defi\" cryptocurrency exchange. Its website, which heavily features the president's image, offers users the opportunity to buy into the exchange using $WLFI tokens. \n\"Good News, the World Liberty Financial token is now live. Crypto is the future, let's embrace this incredible technology and lead the world in the digital economy. Go to World Liberty Financial.com,\" Mr. Trump posted on X in October, before the presidential election. \nThe website says World Liberty is \"inspired by Donald J. Trump\" and Mr. Trump is listed as chief crypto advocate. His sons, Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron, are all listed as Web3 ambassadors. \nDonald Trump Jr. promoted World Liberty Financial in March, at the D.C. Blockchain conference, where crypto industry insiders rubbed shoulders with members of Congress and the administration.\n\"I'm just super excited about what this can mean for the future of banking for the future of financial systems,\" said Trump Jr., who joined World Liberty's panel remotely. Founders Chase Herro, Zak Folkman and Zach Witkoff appeared on stage to promote World Liberty's stablecoin offering.\n\n\"We want Republicans, Democrats, whether it be black, blue, brown, white, to be using our stable coin,\" said Zach Witkoff, the son of Steven Witkoff, the White House special envoy to the Middle East. \"We think it democratizes finance.\" \nWorld Liberty says it has raised more than $550 million from investors who purchase the $WLF governance token. The majority of these investors remain anonymous to the public. For now, these $WLFI tokens are non redeemable, meaning that once they are purchased, users cannot exchange them. \nWorld Liberty denied CBS' multiple requests for an interview.\nJustin Sun, the crypto billionaire famous for buying and eating a $6.2 million banana duct-taped to the wall, is one of World Liberty's few publicly known investors. \nSun, who was being investigated for securities fraud in the Biden administration, said he invested $30 million shortly after Mr. Trump's election, at the time claiming in a post on X to be World Liberty's\"largest investor.\"\nDays before Mr. Trump's inauguration, Sun said he invested another $45 million, which he also disclosed in a post on X. A few weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission reversed itself and asked the judge to grant a stay in Sun's case, citing \"public interest.\" The pause in Sun's case was part of a larger push by the SEC to dismiss cases against crypto companies. \nA spokesperson for Sun and the SEC declined to comment. \nLast month, Democrats on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee sent a letter to the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency about the potential for conflict of interest as the Trump administration considers regulations of companies like World Liberty Financial.\n\"President Trump's involvement in this venture, as he strips financial regulators of their independence\u2026presents an extraordinary conflict of interest that could create unprecedented risks to our financial system,\" said the letter, which was signed by five Democrats, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden and Chris Van Hollen. \nWorld Liberty Financial says 85,000 investors have gone through a standard Know Your Customer process to determine \"participation eligibility,\" and the company says it is arranging for a third-party accounting firm to audit its new venture into the U.S.-debt-backed stablecoins. \nAs president, Mr. Trump is not subject to the criminal conflict-of-interest law. But he is required to disclose his assets and income under the Ethics in Government Act, including his crypto assets. The next financial disclosure report deadline for the president is May 15."

    "original_text": "Liquidity in Cryptocurrency\nThe ease with which a digital token can be converted into a digital asset or cash without affecting its price\nWhat is Liquidity in Cryptocurrency?\nFor any investment, one of the most important considerations is the ability to efficiently buy or sell that asset if and when the investor pleases. After all, what is the point of profit if the seller is not able to realize their gains? The liquidity of the asset will largely determine if and how much of a position a prudent investor will take in the investment \u2013 and this extends to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. \nLiquidity in cryptocurrency means the ease with which a digital currency or token can be converted to another digital asset or cash without impacting the price and vice-versa. Since liquidity is a measure of the outside demand and supply of an asset, a deep market with ample liquidity is an indication of a healthy market. Additionally, the more liquidity available in a cryptocurrency or digital asset, all things being equal, the more stable and less volatile that asset should be.\nIn other words, a liquid cryptocurrency market exists when someone is prepared to buy when you are looking to see; and if you\u2019re buying, someone is willing to sell. It means you may buy that digital asset in the quantity that you want, take profit from a trading opportunity, or in the worst case, cut your losses should the value of the asset fall below your costs, all without moving the market dramatically. \nKey Highlights\nThe ease with which a digital token can be converted into a digital asset or cash without affecting its price is referred to as liquidity in cryptocurrency.\nLiquidity in cryptocurrency reduces investment risk and, more importantly, aids in the development of an exit strategy, making it easier to sell your holdings.\nLiquidity in cryptocurrency allows for price stability and decreased volatility, as well as assists in the analysis of trader activity.\nImportance of Liquidity in Cryptocurrency\nThe cryptocurrency market is dependent on liquidity. Liquidity in cryptocurrency lowers investment risk and, more crucially, assists in defining your exit strategy, making it simple to sell your ownership. As a result, liquid crypto markets are preferred by investors and traders.\n1. Liquidity in cryptocurrency makes it hard to manipulate prices\nLiquidity in cryptocurrency makes it less susceptible to manipulations of the market by dishonest actors or groups of actors.\nAs a fledgling technology, cryptocurrencies currently lack a set path; it is less regulated and contains many unscrupulous people looking to manipulate the market to their advantage. In a deep and liquid digital asset, such as Bitcoin or Ether, controlling the price action in that market becomes difficult for a single market participant or a group of participants.\n2. Liquidity in cryptocurrency offers stability in prices and less volatility\nA liquid market is considered more steady and less volatile as a thriving market with considerable trading activity can bring buy and sell market forces into harmony.\nAs a result, anytime you sell or purchase, there will always be market participants prepared to do the opposite. People can initiate and exit positions in highly liquid markets with little slippage or price fluctuation.\n3. Liquidity in cryptocurrency helps in analyzing behaviors of traders\nLiquidity in cryptocurrency is determined by the number of interested buyers and sellers. Increased market participation means increased liquidity, which can be a signal of increased market data dissemination.\nA larger number of both sell and buy orders reduces volatility and gives traders a comprehensive picture of market forces and can help produce more accurate and reliable technical. Traders will be able to better analyze the market, make accurate predictions, and make well-informed decisions as a result.\n4. Developments in cryptocurrency liquidity\nWe are seeing standardized futures markets pop up for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The futures markets allow investors to trade contracts, or agreements, to buy or sell cryptocurrencies at a pre-agreed later date in a developed and transparent manner.\nIt allows investors to not only to be long or buy and hold a future claim on an asset such as Bitcoin, but also sell BTC short via futures, which means they may take a negative view of Bitcoin without owning it in the first place. The market makers for these futures need to manage their own risk by buying and selling physical cryptocurrencies, thereby deepening the overall market liquidity.\nMeasuring Liquidity in Cryptocurrency\nLiquidity, unlike other trade analysis indicators, has no fixed value. As a result, calculating the exact liquidity of the exchange or market is difficult. However, there are other signs that can be used as proxies for liquidity in cryptocurrencies.\nBid-Ask Spread\nThe gap between the highest bid (selling) price and the lowest ask (purchasing) price in the order book is known as the bid-ask spread. The narrower the spread, the more liquid a cryptocurrency is said to be.\nIf a market for a digital asset is illiquid, investors and speculators would expect to see a wider bid-ask spread, making it more expensive to transact in that digital asset.\nTrading Volume\nTrading volumes are an important factor in determining liquidity in the cryptocurrency market. It refers to the total amount of digital assets exchanged on a cryptocurrency exchange over a given period.\nThe indicator impacts the market players\u2019 direction and behavior. A higher trade value indicates more trading activity (buying and selling), implying greater liquidity and market efficiency. Lower trade volume means less activity and low liquidity.\nMarket Size\nAt present, the size of the overall cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, is still quite small. For example, based on the historical high price that Bitcoin has achieved of around $68,000 USD each and roughly 19 million or so BTC mined, its total market capitalization is around $1.3 trillion, where market capitalization is calculated as the amount of an asset outstanding multiplied by the price of each one of that asset. Industry estimates for the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies in the second half of 2021 is just over $2.5 trillion USD.  \nWhile those might sound like huge amounts of money, we are far from being as large and liquid as other financial markets that professional investors would normally participate in. Let\u2019s look at the market capitalizations of some other assets out there:\nUS Equity, or stocks: $40 trillion USD\nUS Fixed Income, or bonds: $47 trillion USD\nGlobal Equities: $106 trillion USD\nGlobal Fixed Income:  $124 trillion USD\nGold: $12 trillion USD"

    "original_text": "Can you buy crypto with a credit card? See the pros and cons.\nCryptocurrency exchanges and investing apps provide various payment methods, such as ACH bank transfers, debit cards, and credit cards. While not every platform will allow you to purchase cryptocurrency with a credit card, you can do some research and find an exchange that accepts it.\nBut just because you can purchase crypto with a credit card doesn't mean you should. In addition to the risk of accruing high-interest debt, charging crypto purchases to a credit card could come with cash-advance fees or other complications. Review the pros and cons of this payment method before you decide.\nIs it possible to buy crypto with a credit card?\nPurchasing crypto with a credit card is possible, but only on certain crypto exchanges and investment apps. Debit cards and ACH bank transfers are more common payment methods.\nFor example, Robinhood is a popular investment app that allows you to buy crypto through its Robinhood Connect service. However, the only available payment methods are debit cards, bank account transfers, and using your Robinhood Buying Power.\nCompare that to the Kraken crypto exchange, where you can buy crypto with a debit or credit card, Apple Pay or Google Pay, your cash balance, or Plaid ACH. However, Kraken requires an eligible verified membership to add a payment card, and you might have to pay fees to use a card.\nCan you use credit card rewards to buy crypto?\nYou can\u2019t redeem most credit card rewards directly for crypto purchases, but there are ways to indirectly purchase crypto with your cash back, points, or miles. Many cash-back credit cards provide two redemption options that could indirectly fund your crypto investments: statement credits and bank deposits.\nA statement credit can cover some or all of your credit card balance, including a recent crypto purchase. A bank deposit gives you cash you can use for just about anything, including crypto purchases \u2014 if your chosen platform supports ACH transfers.\nWhy have my crypto purchases been rejected on my credit card?\nFinancial institutions have different policies regarding purchasing crypto using credit or debit cards. This could include anti-fraud measures, in which case you must contact your bank to confirm the transaction. However, some credit cards may not be accepted on a crypto exchange, so you would have to try an alternative card or payment method.\nRead more: Does getting your credit card declined hurt your credit score?\nWhy am I being charged a cash advance fee for purchasing crypto with my credit card?\nSome banks treat specific types of purchases as cash advances. For example, Chase has a list of purchases it considers \u201ccash-like transactions\u201d that will be treated like cash advances. These include, but aren\u2019t limited to, purchasing lottery tickets, money orders, wire transfers, and cryptocurrency.\nCash-advance terms and conditions vary by card but often include high interest rates and added fees. There\u2019s typically no grace period with the interest rate on a cash advance, so expect interest to start accruing immediately.\nIf your issuer categorizes a crypto purchase as a cash advance, it's also likely that you won't earn credit card rewards on the purchase.\nWhich exchanges and investing apps allow credit card crypto purchases?\nThese are some popular crypto exchanges and investment apps and their accepted payment methods for buying cryptocurrency.\n4 steps to buy crypto with a credit card\n1. Find a suitable crypto exchange or investment app and set up an account\nThere are many available crypto exchanges and investment apps where you can buy cryptocurrency. These include exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase and apps like Robinhood and Cash App.\nNote that not every exchange or app has access to every type of cryptocurrency. If you want to buy, sell, or exchange a specific type of crypto, you need to find a platform that supports it.\n2. If required, fund your account and complete identity verification\nSome platforms require you to fund your account with fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar (USD), before you can buy crypto. This could be where you use a credit card to add funds if the platform supports credit card payments.\nYou might also have to verify your identity through know-your-customer (KYC) verification. This security measure helps ensure you are who you say you are and helps prevent identity theft and fraud.\nKYC verification could ask you to provide your address, date of birth, last four digits of your Social Security number, and other personal information.\n3. Purchase your desired cryptocurrency\nOnce your account is set up, it\u2019s time to buy crypto. Most crypto platforms support well-known cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Expect to pay additional transaction fees if you\u2019re using a credit card to make your purchase.\n4. Store your crypto\nMany crypto platforms automatically store your crypto after you purchase it. This could include holding it in cold storage with no internet connection or hot storage connected to the internet.\nYou can also move your crypto to your own cold or hot storage, such as a digital crypto wallet mobile app you can access from your phone or a USB drive you must plug into a computer to access.\nPros and cons of buying crypto with a credit card\nWhile purchasing crypto with a credit card is doable, the risks likely outweigh any potential rewards. Get familiar with the terms and conditions of your credit card and crypto exchange, then consider the following benefits and drawbacks before you make a decision.\nBuying crypto with a credit card FAQs\nIs it safe to buy crypto with a credit card?\nBuying crypto with a credit card is typically safe if it\u2019s an accepted payment option with a reputable crypto exchange or investment app. However, you'll likely have to pay additional fees for a credit card payment. Your card issuer could also charge you a cash advance fee and interest for cryptocurrency purchases. Lastly, you risk accruing high-interest credit card debt if you can't pay off the purchase immediately.\nWhat are the fees for buying crypto with a credit card?\nThere are often fees associated with buying crypto with a credit card, but they vary by platform and card issuer. Research the fee schedules of specific platforms to see the associated costs. You should also review the terms of your credit cards to see how crypto purchases are categorized \u2014 or if they're allowed at all.\nCan I buy on Coinbase with a credit card?\nNo, Coinbase no longer accepts credit card payments. The following are the Coinbase-accepted payment methods: debit card, ACH transfer, PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.\nWhere can I buy cryptocurrencies?\nYou can buy and sell crypto on specialized crypto exchanges and investment apps that support crypto trading. These include popular platforms like Robinhood, Gemini, Kraken, Coinbase, Cash App, and more.\nWhere can I buy bitcoin with a credit card?\nIf you want to buy BTC, these are some platforms that accept credit cards as a payment method to purchase cryptocurrency:\nKraken\nCrypto.com\nBitMart"
