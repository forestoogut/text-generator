What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous person or team who outlined the technology in a 2008 white paper. It’s an appealingly simple concept: bitcoin is digital money that allows for secure peer-to-peer transactions on the internet.
Unlike services like Venmo and PayPal, which rely on the traditional financial system for permission to transfer money and on existing debit/credit accounts, bitcoin is decentralized: any two people, anywhere in the world, can send bitcoin to each other without the involvement of a bank, government, or other institution.
Every transaction involving Bitcoin is tracked on the blockchain, which is similar to a bank’s ledger, or log of customers’ funds going in and out of the bank. In simple terms, it’s a record of every transaction ever made using bitcoin.
Unlike a bank’s ledger, the Bitcoin blockchain is distributed across the entire network. No company, country, or third party is in control of it; and anyone can become part of that network.
There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. This is digital money that cannot be inflated or manipulated in any way.
It isn’t necessary to buy an entire bitcoin: you can buy just a fraction of one if that’s all you want or need.

Bitcoin Basics
Since Bitcoin’s creation, thousands of new cryptocurrencies have been launched, but bitcoin (abbreviated as BTC) remains the largest by market capitalization and trading volume.

Depending on your goals, bitcoin can function as
- an investment vehicle
- a store of value similar to gold
- a way to transfer value around the world
- even just a way to explore an emerging technology
Bitcoin is a currency native to the Internet. Unlike government-issued currencies such as the dollar or euro, Bitcoin allows online transfers without a middleman such as a bank or payment processor. The removal of those gatekeepers creates a whole range of new possibilities, including the potential for money to move around the global internet more quickly and cheaply, and allowing individuals to have maximum control over their own assets.
Bitcoin is legal to use, hold, and trade, and can be spent on everything from travel to charitable donations. It’s accepted as payment by businesses including Microsoft and Expedia.
Is bitcoin money? It’s been used as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account—which are all properties of money. Meanwhile, it only exists digitally; there is no physical version of it.
Who created Bitcoin?
To really grasp how bitcoin works, it helps to start at the beginning. The question of who created bitcoin is a fascinating one, because a decade after inventing the technology—and despite a lot of digging by journalists and members of the crypto community—its creator remains anonymous.
The principles behind Bitcoin first appeared in a white paper published online in late 2008 by a person or group going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto.
This paper wasn’t the first idea for digital money drawing on the fields of cryptography and computer science—in fact, the paper referred to earlier concepts—but it was a uniquely elegant solution to the problem of establishing trust between different online entities, where people may be hidden (like bitcoin’s own creator) by pseudonyms, or physically located on the other side of the planet.
Nakamoto devised a pair of intertwined concepts: the bitcoin private key and the blockchain ledger. When you hold bitcoin, you control it through a private key—a string of randomized numbers and letters that unlocks a virtual vault containing your purchase. Each private key is tracked on the virtual ledger called the blockchain.
When Bitcoin first appeared, it marked a major advance in computer science, because it solved a fundamental problem of commerce on the internet: how do you transfer value between two people without a trusted intermediary (like a bank) in the middle? By solving that problem, the invention of bitcoin has wide-ranging ramifications: As a currency designed for the internet, it allows for financial transactions that range across borders and around the globe without the involvement of banks, credit-card companies, lenders, or even governments. When any two people—wherever they might live—can send payments to each other without encountering those gatekeepers, it creates the potential for an open financial system that is more efficient, more free, and more innovative. That, in a nutshell, is bitcoin explained.

Bitcoin creates the potential for an open financial system that is more efficient, more free, and more innovative.
How Bitcoin works
Unlike credit card networks like Visa and payment processors like Paypal, bitcoin is not owned by an individual or company. Bitcoin is the world’s first completely open payment network which anyone with an internet connection can participate in. Bitcoin was designed to be used on the internet, and doesn’t depend on banks or private companies to process transactions.
One of the most important elements of Bitcoin is the blockchain, which tracks who owns what, similar to how a bank tracks assets. What sets the Bitcoin blockchain apart from a bank's ledger is that it is decentralized, meaning anyone can view it and no single entity controls it.
Here are some details about how it all works:
Specialized computers known as ‘mining rigs’ perform the equations required to verify and record a new transaction. In the early days, a typical desktop PC was powerful enough to participate, which allowed pretty much anyone who was curious to try their hand at mining. These days the computers required are massive, specialized, and often owned by businesses or large numbers of individuals pooling their resources. (In October 2019, it required 12 trillion times more computing power to mine one bitcoin than it did when Nakamoto mined the first blocks in January 2009.)

The miners’ collective computing power is used to ensure the accuracy of the ever-growing ledger. Bitcoin is inextricably tied to the blockchain; each new bitcoin is recorded on it, as is each subsequent transaction with all existing coins.
How does the network motivate miners to participate in the constant, essential work of maintaining the blockchain—verifying transactions? The Bitcoin network holds a continuous lottery in which all the mining rigs around the world race to be the first to solve a math problem. Every 10 min or so, a winner is found, and the winner updates the Bitcoin ledger with new valid transactions. The prize changes over time, but in May 2020, the reward for each winner of this raffle went from 12.5 bitcoin per block to 6.25, and in 2024, with the halving, this reward further dropped from 6.25 to 3.125 as a mechanism to increase scarcity.
At the beginning, a bitcoin was technically worthless. At the end of 2019, it was trading at around $7,500, and in November 2021, it topped $64,000. As bitcoin’s value has risen, its easy divisibility (the ability to buy a small fraction of one bitcoin) has become a key attribute. One bitcoin is currently divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin); the bitcoin community refers to the smallest unit as a ‘Satoshi.’
Nakamoto set the network up so that the number of bitcoin will never exceed 21 million, ensuring scarcity. As of December 2023, there were around 1,4 million bitcoins still available to be mined. The last blocks will theoretically be mined in 2140.

Cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies share some traits — like how you can use them to buy things or how you can transfer them electronically — but they’re also different in interesting ways. Here are a few highlights.
Bitcoin is the world’s first completely open payment network which anyone with an internet connection can participate in.
Key question
How does bitcoin have value?
Essentially the same way a traditional currency does – because it’s proven itself to be a viable and convenient way to store value, which means it can easily be traded for goods, services, or other assets. It’s scarce, secure, portable (compared to, say, gold), and easily divisible, allowing transactions of all sizes.

How to get Bitcoin
The easiest way to buy bitcoin is to purchase it through an online exchange like Coinbase. Coinbase makes it easy to buy, sell, send, receive, and store bitcoin without needing to hold it yourself using something called public and private keys.
How to buy bitcoin, with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong
However, if you choose to buy and store bitcoin outside of an online exchange, here’s how that works.
Each person who joins the bitcoin network is issued a public key, which is a long string of letters and numbers that you can think of like an email address, and a private key, which is equivalent to a password.
When you buy bitcoin—or send/receive it—you get a public key, which you can think of as a key that unlocks a virtual vault and gives you access to your money.
Anyone can send bitcoin to you via your public key, but only the holder of the private key can access the bitcoin in the “virtual vault” once it’s been sent.
There are many ways to store bitcoin both online and off. The simplest solution is a virtual wallet.
If you want to transfer money from your wallet to a bank account after selling your bitcoin, the Coinbase app makes it as easy as transferring funds from one bank to another. Similar to conventional bank transfers or ATM withdrawals, exchanges like Coinbase set a daily limit, and it may take between a few days and a week for the transaction to be completed.

Key question
What’s the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain?
All bitcoin transactions and public keys are recorded on a virtual ledger called the blockchain. The ledger is effectively a chronological list of transactions. This ledger is copied—exactly—across every computer that is connected to the bitcoin network, and it is constantly checked and secured using a vast amount of computing power across the globe. The blockchain concept has turned out to be powerful and adaptable, and there are now a wide variety of non-cryptocurrency-related blockchains that are used for things like supply-chain management. The ‘Bitcoin Blockchain’ specifically refers to the virtual ledger that records bitcoin transactions and private keys.
How to use Bitcoin
Back in 2013, a bitcoin enthusiast named Laszlo Hanyecz created a message-board post offering 10,000 BTC – which then was worth around $25 – to anyone who would deliver two pizzas to his Jacksonville, Florida, home. As the legend goes, those two pizzas, which another bitcoin early-adopter bought from a local Papa John’s, marked the first successful purchase of non-virtual goods using bitcoin. Thankfully it’s a lot easier to use bitcoin these days!
It’s simple: Transactions using BTC aren’t that different from those using a credit or debit card, but instead of being asked to enter card info, you’ll simply be entering the payment amount and the vendor’s public key (similar to an email address) via a wallet app. (When transacting in person using smartphones or tablets, often a QR code will pop up to simplify the process – when you scan the code, your wallet app will automatically enter the pertinent information.)
It’s private: One of the benefits of paying with bitcoin is that doing so limits the amount of personal information you need to provide. The only time you need to share your name and address is if you’re purchasing physical goods that need to be shipped.
It’s flexible: As to what you should do with your bitcoin, that depends completely on your personal interests. Here are some ideas:
You can sell it for cash using an exchange or a Bitcoin ATM.
You can spend it online or in brick-and-mortar retailers as you would any other currency by using a Bitcoin debit card.
You can hold on to some or all of it as part of your investment and savings strategy.
You might choose to that is close to your heart (check out).
And if you have a serious budget and unfulfilled astronaut dreams? Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic happily accepts BTC in exchange for the opportunity to blast off on one of its forthcoming space-tourism missions.
Due to the cryptographic nature of the Bitcoin network, bitcoin payments are fundamentally more secure than standard debit/credit card transactions.
What makes Bitcoin a new kind of money?
Bitcoin is global. You can send it across the planet as easily as you can pay with cash in the physical world. It isn't closed on weekends, doesn’t charge you a fee to access your money, and doesn't impose any arbitrary limits.
Bitcoin is irreversible. Bitcoin is like cash, in the sense that transactions cannot be reversed by the sender. In comparison, credit cards, conventional online payment systems, and banking transactions can be reversed after the payment has been made—sometimes months after the initial transaction—due to the centralized intermediaries that complete the transactions. This creates higher fraud risk for merchants, which can lead to higher fees for using credit cards.
Bitcoin is private. When paying with bitcoin, there are no bank statements, or any need to provide unnecessary personal information to the merchant. Bitcoin transactions don’t contain any identifying information other than the bitcoin addresses and amounts involved.
Bitcoin is secure. Due to the cryptographic nature of the Bitcoin network, bitcoin payments are fundamentally more secure than standard debit/credit card transactions. When making a bitcoin payment, no sensitive information is required to be sent over the internet. There is a very low risk of your financial information being compromised, or having your identity stolen.
Bitcoin is open. Every transaction on the Bitcoin network is published publicly, without exception. This means there's no room for manipulation of transactions (save for a highly unlikely 51% attack scenario) or changing the supply of bitcoin. The software that constitutes the core of Bitcoin is free and open-source so anyone can review the code.
Bitcoin is safe. In more than ten years of existence, the bitcoin network has never been successfully hacked. And because the system is permissionless and open-sourced, countless computer scientists and cryptographers have been able to examine all aspects of the network and its security.
Where does Bitcoin come from?
Bitcoin is virtually ‘mined’ by a vast, decentralized (also referred to as ‘peer-to-peer’) network of computers that are constantly verifying and securing the accuracy of the blockchain. Every single bitcoin transaction is reflected on that ledger, with new information periodically gathered together in a “block,” which is added to all the blocks that came before.

Defining Ether and Ethereum
Created in 2015, Ether is known as the fuel for operating the Ethereum platform.  Ether, like other digital currencies, can be used to pay for goods and services. But it is also used to support the development of applications on the Ethereum network.
Oftentimes, the word Ethereum is used to represent both the network as well as Ether.
To better understand the uses of Ether, let’s first look at the Ethereum platform.
Ethereum
Ethereum is an open-ended, decentralized, blockchain-based, public software platform that facilitates peer-to-peer contracts, known as Smart Contracts, as well as Decentralized Applications, known as DApps.
Smart contracts allow users to exchange value without requiring an intermediary.  Smart contracts are agreements with defined terms and protocols in place to enforce them.
But unlike traditional contracts, written in human languages and enforced by courts of law, smart contracts are written in code that a computer can execute, which eliminates ambiguity.
The Ethereum network acts as a single decentralized computer that runs the smart contract code. This means that all computers participating in the Ethereum network will come to consensus on the outcome of each smart contract.
Traditional software applications often rely on central authorities to store data and perform operations on that data. This requires trust in the central authority.
DApps can make use of smart contracts on the Ethereum network to achieve decentralization. Smart contracts can store data. The Ethereum network enforces that all operations on the data happen according to the smart contract code. In other words, the data maintains its integrity without a central trusted party.
Ether
In order to support the Ethereum network, developers need the cryptocurrency, Ether, to create and run applications. Ether is used to pay for transaction fees and computational services. 
Users can send Ether to other users, and developers can write smart contracts that receive, hold, and send Ether.
Ether comes into existence by the validation of transactions on the Ethereum platform, through a process called mining.  Those performing this validation are referred to as “miners”.
When miners successfully verify a group of transactions, they are awarded Ether.  Miners follow a set of cryptographic rules which keep the network stable, safe and secure. 
Ether transactions are recorded and verified on a digital public ledger called blockchain. 
HOW DO YOU OBTAIN ETHER?
There are multiple ways for an individual to obtain Ether.
It can be purchased on an exchange using a fiat currency under the symbol ETH.
It can be exchanged for Bitcoin on exchanges that offer a BTC-ETH pair.
It can be transferred to you from another person or entity.
It can be earned as a miner, through joining a mining pool or by purchasing a cloud mining contract
ETHEREUM WALLETS
Before taking possession of Ether, an individual must have an Ethereum wallet. 
Secure Ethereum wallets can be downloaded and set up onto a computer, smartphone or other mobile device. 
Each Ethereum wallet stores an individual’s private key which allows the wallet owner to sign transactions that send Ether to other parties.
WHY WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN OWNING ETHER?
As previously mentioned, Ether is needed by developers to create Smart Contracts and DApps on the Ethereum network.
Additionally, Ether can be used as an investment whose value can go up or down.  It can be owned or used as a tradable instrument.
Ether is a critical component to keeping the Ethereum platform growing and evolving in the digital asset environment.

What is Cryptocurrency and how does it work?

Cryptocurrency – meaning and definition
Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuing or regulating authority, instead using a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.
What is cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It’s a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.
Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.
The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was founded in 2009 and remains the best known today. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.
How does cryptocurrency work?
Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders.
Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets.
If you own cryptocurrency, you don’t own anything tangible. What you own is a key that allows you to move a record or a unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party.
Although Bitcoin has been around since 2009, cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain technology are still emerging in financial terms, and more uses are expected in the future. Transactions including bonds, stocks, and other financial assets could eventually be traded using the technology.
Cryptocurrency examples
There are thousands of cryptocurrencies. Some of the best known include:
Bitcoin:
Founded in 2009, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the most commonly traded. The currency was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto – widely believed to be a pseudonym for an individual or group of people whose precise identity remains unknown.
Ethereum:
Developed in 2015, Ethereum is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH) or Ethereum. It is the most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.
Litecoin:
This currency is most similar to bitcoin but has moved more quickly to develop new innovations, including faster payments and processes to allow more transactions.
Ripple:
Ripple is a distributed ledger system that was founded in 2012. Ripple can be used to track different kinds of transactions, not just cryptocurrency. The company behind it has worked with various banks and financial institutions.
Non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies are collectively known as “altcoins” to distinguish them from the original.
How to buy cryptocurrency
You may be wondering how to buy cryptocurrency safely. There are typically three steps involved. These are:
Step 1: Choosing a platform
The first step is deciding which platform to use. Generally, you can choose between a traditional broker or dedicated cryptocurrency exchange:
Traditional brokers. These are online brokers who offer ways to buy and sell cryptocurrency, as well as other financial assets like stocks, bonds, and ETFs. These platforms tend to offer lower trading costs but fewer crypto features.
Cryptocurrency exchanges. There are many cryptocurrency exchanges to choose from, each offering different cryptocurrencies, wallet storage, interest-bearing account options, and more. Many exchanges charge asset-based fees.
When comparing different platforms, consider which cryptocurrencies are on offer, what fees they charge, their security features, storage and withdrawal options, and any educational resources.
Step 2: Funding your account
Once you have chosen your platform, the next step is to fund your account so you can begin trading. Most crypto exchanges allow users to purchase crypto using fiat (i.e., government-issued) currencies such as the US Dollar, the British Pound, or the Euro using their debit or credit cards – although this varies by platform.
Crypto purchases with credit cards are considered risky, and some exchanges don't support them. Some credit card companies don't allow crypto transactions either. This is because cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and it is not advisable to risk going into debt — or potentially paying high credit card transaction fees — for certain assets.
Some platforms will also accept ACH transfers and wire transfers. The accepted payment methods and time taken for deposits or withdrawals differ per platform. Equally, the time taken for deposits to clear varies by payment method.
An important factor to consider is fees. These include potential deposit and withdrawal transaction fees plus trading fees. Fees will vary by payment method and platform, which is something to research at the outset.
Step 3: Placing an order
You can place an order via your broker's or exchange's web or mobile platform. If you are planning to buy cryptocurrencies, you can do so by selecting "buy," choosing the order type, entering the amount of cryptocurrencies you want to purchase, and confirming the order. The same process applies to "sell" orders.
There are also other ways to invest in crypto. These include payment services like PayPal, Cash App, and Venmo, which allow users to buy, sell, or hold cryptocurrencies. In addition, there are the following investment vehicles:
Bitcoin trusts: You can buy shares of Bitcoin trusts with a regular brokerage account. These vehicles give retail investors exposure to crypto through the stock market. 
Bitcoin mutual funds: There are Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin mutual funds to choose from. 
Blockchain stocks or ETFs: You can also indirectly invest in crypto through blockchain companies that specialize in the technology behind crypto and crypto transactions. Alternatively, you can buy stocks or ETFs of companies that use blockchain technology.
The best option for you will depend on your investment goals and risk appetite.
How to store cryptocurrency
Once you have purchased cryptocurrency, you need to store it safely to protect it from hacks or theft. Usually, cryptocurrency is stored in crypto wallets, which are physical devices or online software used to store the private keys to your cryptocurrencies securely. Some exchanges provide wallet services, making it easy for you to store directly through the platform. However, not all exchanges or brokers automatically provide wallet services for you.
There are different wallet providers to choose from. The terms “hot wallet” and “cold wallet” are used:
Hot wallet storage: "hot wallets" refer to crypto storage that uses online software to protect the private keys to your assets.
Cold wallet storage: Unlike hot wallets, cold wallets (also known as hardware wallets) rely on offline electronic devices to securely store your private keys.
Typically, cold wallets tend to charge fees, while hot wallets don't.

What can you buy with cryptocurrency?
When it was first launched, Bitcoin was intended to be a medium for daily transactions, making it possible to buy everything from a cup of coffee to a computer or even big-ticket items like real estate. That hasn’t quite materialized and, while the number of institutions accepting cryptocurrencies is growing, large transactions involving it are rare. Even so, it is possible to buy a wide variety of products from e-commerce websites using crypto. Here are some examples:
Technology and e-commerce sites:
Several companies that sell tech products accept crypto on their websites, such as newegg.com, AT&T, and Microsoft. Overstock, an e-commerce platform, was among the first sites to accept Bitcoin. Shopify, Rakuten, and Home Depot also accept it.
Luxury goods:
Some luxury retailers accept crypto as a form of payment. For example, online luxury retailer Bitdials offers Rolex, Patek Philippe, and other high-end watches in return for Bitcoin.
Cars:
Some car dealers – from mass-market brands to high-end luxury dealers – already accept cryptocurrency as payment.
Insurance:
In April 2021, Swiss insurer AXA announced that it had begun accepting Bitcoin as a mode of payment for all its lines of insurance except life insurance (due to regulatory issues). Premier Shield Insurance, which sells home and auto insurance policies in the US, also accepts Bitcoin for premium payments.
If you want to spend cryptocurrency at a retailer that doesn’t accept it directly, you can use a cryptocurrency debit card, such as BitPay in the US.

Cryptocurrency fraud and cryptocurrency scams
Unfortunately, cryptocurrency crime is on the rise. Cryptocurrency scams include:
Fake websites: Bogus sites which feature fake testimonials and crypto jargon promising massive, guaranteed returns, provided you keep investing.
Virtual Ponzi schemes: Cryptocurrency criminals promote non-existent opportunities to invest in digital currencies and create the illusion of huge returns by paying off old investors with new investors’ money. One scam operation, BitClub Network, raised more than $700 million before its perpetrators were indicted in December 2019.
"Celebrity" endorsements: Scammers pose online as billionaires or well-known names who promise to multiply your investment in a virtual currency but instead steal what you send. They may also use messaging apps or chat rooms to start rumours that a famous businessperson is backing a specific cryptocurrency. Once they have encouraged investors to buy and driven up the price, the scammers sell their stake, and the currency reduces in value.
Romance scams: The FBI warns of a trend in online dating scams, where tricksters persuade people they meet on dating apps or social media to invest or trade in virtual currencies. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Centre fielded more than 1,800 reports of crypto-focused romance scams in the first seven months of 2021, with losses reaching $133 million.
Otherwise, fraudsters may pose as legitimate virtual currency traders or set up bogus exchanges to trick people into giving them money. Another crypto scam involves fraudulent sales pitches for individual retirement accounts in cryptocurrencies. Then there is straightforward cryptocurrency hacking, where criminals break into the digital wallets where people store their virtual currency to steal it.

Is cryptocurrency safe?
Cryptocurrencies are usually built using blockchain technology. Blockchain describes the way transactions are recorded into "blocks" and time stamped. It's a fairly complex, technical process, but the result is a digital ledger of cryptocurrency transactions that's hard for hackers to tamper with.
In addition, transactions require a two-factor authentication process. For instance, you might be asked to enter a username and password to start a transaction. Then, you might have to enter an authentication code sent via text to your personal cell phone.
While securities are in place, that does not mean cryptocurrencies are un-hackable. Several high-dollar hacks have cost cryptocurrency start-ups heavily. Hackers hit Coincheck to the tune of $534 million and BitGrail for $195 million, making them two of the biggest cryptocurrency hacks of 2018.
Unlike government-backed money, the value of virtual currencies is driven entirely by supply and demand. This can create wild swings that produce significant gains for investors or big losses. And cryptocurrency investments are subject to far less regulatory protection than traditional financial products like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
Four tips to invest in cryptocurrency safely
According to Consumer Reports, all investments carry risk, but some experts consider cryptocurrency to be one of the riskier investment choices out there. If you are planning to invest in cryptocurrencies, these tips can help you make educated choices.
Research exchanges:
Before you invest, learn about cryptocurrency exchanges. It’s estimated that there are over 500 exchanges to choose from. Do your research, read reviews, and talk with more experienced investors before moving forward.
Know how to store your digital currency:
If you buy cryptocurrency, you have to store it. You can keep it on an exchange or in a digital wallet. While there are different kinds of wallets, each has its benefits, technical requirements, and security. As with exchanges, you should investigate your storage choices before investing.
Diversify your investments:
Diversification is key to any good investment strategy, and this holds true when you are investing in cryptocurrency. Don't put all your money in Bitcoin, for example, just because that's the name you know. There are thousands of options, and it's better to spread your investment across several currencies.
Prepare for volatility:
The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, so be prepared for ups and downs. You will see dramatic swings in prices. If your investment portfolio or mental wellbeing can't handle that, cryptocurrency might not be a wise choice for you.
Cryptocurrency is all the rage right now, but remember, it is still in its relative infancy and is considered highly speculative. Investing in something new comes with challenges, so be prepared. If you plan to participate, do your research, and invest conservatively to start.
One of the best ways you can stay safe online is by using a comprehensive antivirus. Kaspersky Internet Security defends you from malware infections, spyware, data theft and protects your online payments using bank-grade encryption.

Cryptocurrency Basics: Pros, Cons and How It Works
Cryptocurrency (or “crypto”) is a digital currency that can be used to buy goods and services or traded for a profit. Bitcoin is the most widely used cryptocurrency.


What is cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrency (or “crypto”) is a digital currency, such as Bitcoin, that is used as an alternative payment method or speculative investment. Cryptocurrencies get their name from the cryptographic techniques that let people spend them securely without the need for a central government or bank.
Here are a few examples:
Bitcoin was initially developed primarily to be a form of payment that isn't controlled or distributed by a central bank. While financial institutions have traditionally been necessary to verify that a payment has been processed successfully, Bitcoin accomplishes this securely, without that central authority.
Ethereum uses the same underlying technology as Bitcoin, but instead of strictly peer-to-peer payments, the cryptocurrency is used to pay for transactions on the Ethereum network. This network, built on the Ethereum blockchain, enables entire financial ecosystems to operate without a central authority. To visualize this, think insurance without the insurance company, or real estate titling without the title company.
Scores of altcoins (broadly defined as any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin) arose to capitalize on the various — and at times promising — use cases for blockchain technology.
Meme coins, a subcategory of altcoins, are joke cryptocurrencies that represent internet memes. Some meme coins, such as Dogecoin, have risen to substantial market caps, despite having no serious use cases.

Why do people invest in cryptocurrencies?
People invest in cryptocurrencies for the same reason anyone invests in anything. They hope its value will rise, netting them a profit.
If demand for Bitcoin grows, for example, the interplay of supply and demand could push up its value. If people began using Bitcoin for payments on a huge scale, demand for Bitcoin would go up, and in turn, its price in dollars would increase. So, if you'd purchased one Bitcoin before that increase in demand, you could theoretically sell that one Bitcoin for more U.S. dollars than you bought it for, making a profit.
The same principles apply to Ethereum. "Ether" is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, where developers can build decentralized finance (or "DeFi") apps without the need for a third-party financial institution. Developers must use Ether to build and run applications on Ethereum, so theoretically, the more that is built on the Ethereum blockchain, the higher the demand for Ether.
However, it's important to note that to some, cryptocurrencies aren't investments at all. Bitcoin enthusiasts, for example, hail it as a much-improved monetary system over our current one and would prefer we spend and accept it as everyday payment. One common refrain — "one Bitcoin is one Bitcoin" — underscores the view that Bitcoin shouldn't be measured in USD, but rather by the value it brings as a new monetary system.
How does cryptocurrency work?
Cryptocurrencies are supported by a technology known as blockchain, which maintains a tamper-resistant record of transactions and keeps track of who owns what. The use of blockchains addressed a problem faced by previous efforts to create purely digital currencies: preventing people from making copies of their holdings and attempting to spend it twice.
Individual units of cryptocurrencies can be referred to as coins or tokens, depending on how they are used. Some are intended to be units of exchange for goods and services, others are stores of value, and some can be used to participate in specific software programs such as games and financial products.
How are cryptocurrencies created?
One common way cryptocurrencies are created is through a process known as mining, which is used by Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining can be an energy-intensive process in which computers solve complex puzzles in order to verify the authenticity of transactions on the network. As a reward, the owners of those computers can receive newly created cryptocurrency. Other cryptocurrencies use different methods, such as proof of stake, to create and distribute tokens, and many have a significantly lighter environmental impact.
For most people, the easiest way to get cryptocurrency is to buy it, either from an exchange or another user.
Why are there so many kinds of cryptocurrency?
It’s important to remember that Bitcoin is different from cryptocurrency in general. While Bitcoin is the first and most valuable cryptocurrency, the market is large — there are thousands of cryptocurrencies. And while some cryptocurrencies have total market valuations in the hundreds of billions of dollars, others are obscure and essentially worthless.
If you’re thinking about getting into cryptocurrency, it can be helpful to start with one that is commonly traded and relatively well-established in the market. These coins typically have the largest market capitalizations.
Thoughtfully selecting your cryptocurrency, however, is no guarantee of success in such a volatile space. Sometimes, an issue in the deeply interconnected crypto industry can spill out and have broad implications on asset values. For example, when crypto exchange FTX collapsed in November 2022, the price of Bitcoin fell more than 20% over the following two months.
Are cryptocurrencies financial securities, like stocks?
Whether or not cryptocurrency is a security is a bit of a gray area right now. To back up a little, generally, a "security" in finance is anything that represents a value and can be traded. Stocks are securities because they represent ownership in a public company. Bonds are securities because they represent a debt owed to the bondholder. And both of these securities can be traded on public markets.

Regulators have increasingly signaled that cryptocurrencies should be regulated similarly to other securities, such as stocks and bonds. However, with the June 2024 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo Supreme Court ruling, that may change — Congress may have to clearly define crypto regulation through law making rather than allowing the SEC to enforce rules based on its interpretation. That could have major implications for the asset class in the future.
Pros and cons of cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency inspires passionate opinions across the spectrum of investors. Here are a few reasons that some people believe it is a transformational technology, while others worry it's a fad.
Cryptocurrency pros
Cryptocurrency is a volatile investment, but in the long term, many coins have risen in value considerably. Bitcoin's price has increased roughly tenfold over the last five years, despite several bull and bear markets over that time. It topped $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, and though it fell significantly in the months after that, once again surpassed the psychologically-important $100,000 level again on May 8, 2025. By May 22, it had hit yet another all-time high of $111,000.
Some supporters like the fact that cryptocurrency removes central banks from managing the money supply since over time these banks tend to reduce the value of money via inflation.
In communities that have been underserved by the traditional financial system, some people see cryptocurrencies as a promising foothold. Pew Research Center data from 2021 found that Asian, Black and Hispanic people "are more likely than White adults to say they have ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency
[2]
."
Other advocates like the blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies, because it’s a decentralized processing and recording system and can be more secure than traditional payment systems. It may also provide a cheaper way to send money internationally; although crypto networks typically charge transaction fees, many traditional international money transfer services charge substantial fees themselves.
Some cryptocurrencies offer their owners the opportunity to earn passive income through a process called staking. Crypto staking involves using your cryptocurrencies to help verify transactions on a blockchain protocol. Though staking has its risks, it can allow you to grow your crypto holdings without buying more.
Cryptocurrency cons
Many cryptocurrency projects are untested, and blockchain technology in general has yet to gain wide adoption. If the underlying idea behind cryptocurrency does not reach its potential, long-term investors may never see the returns they hoped for.
For shorter-term crypto investors, there are other risks. Its prices tend to change rapidly, and while that means that many people have made money quickly by buying in at the right time, many others have lost money by doing so just before a crypto crash.
Those wild shifts in value may also cut against the basic ideas behind the projects that cryptocurrencies were created to support. For example, people may be less likely to use Bitcoin as a payment system if they are not sure what it will be worth the next day.
The environmental impact of Bitcoin and other projects that use similar mining protocols is significant. A comparison by the University of Cambridge, for instance, said worldwide Bitcoin mining consumes more than twice as much power as all U.S. residential lightin. Some cryptocurrencies use different technology that demands less energy.
Governments around the world have not yet fully reckoned with how to handle cryptocurrency, so regulatory changes and crackdowns have the potential to affect the market in unpredictable ways.
Many cryptocurrency networks charge a fee for any transaction, including buying or selling crypto as an investor. These can vary wildly, and high fees can cut into returns. Bitcoin transaction fees, for example, have varied between less than 50 cents and more than $100 per transaction over the last year, during periods of exceptionally low or high transaction activity.
Cryptocurrency legal and tax issues
There’s no question that cryptocurrencies are legal in the U.S. Ultimately whether they’re legal worldwide depends on each individual country.
The question of whether cryptocurrencies are legally allowed, however, is only one part of the legal question. Other things to consider include how crypto is taxed and what you can buy with cryptocurrency.
Legal tender: You might call them cryptocurrencies, but they differ from traditional currencies in one important way: there's no requirement in most places that they be accepted as "legal tender." The U.S. dollar, by contrast, must be accepted for "all debts, public and private." Countries around the world are taking various approaches to cryptocurrency. For now, only one country, El Salvador, accepts Bitcoin as legal tender. In the U.S., what you can buy with cryptocurrency depends on the preferences of the seller.
Crypto taxes: Again, the term "currency" is a bit of a red herring when it comes to taxes in the U.S. Cryptocurrencies are taxed as property, rather than currency. That means that when you sell them, you'll pay tax on the capital gains, or the difference between the price of the purchase and sale. And if you're given crypto as payment — or as a reward for an activity such as mining — you'll be taxed on the value at the time you received them.
Your decision: Is cryptocurrency a good investment?
Cryptocurrency is a relatively risky investment, no matter which way you slice it. Generally speaking, high-risk investments should make up a small part of your overall portfolio — one common guideline is no more than 10%. You may want to look first to shore up your retirement savings, pay off debt or invest in less-volatile funds made up of stocks and bonds.
There are other ways to manage risk within your crypto portfolio, such as by diversifying the range of cryptocurrencies that you buy. Crypto assets may rise and fall at different rates, and over different time periods, so by investing in several different products you can insulate yourself — to some degree — from losses in one of your holdings.
Perhaps the most important thing when investing in anything is to do your homework. This is particularly important when it comes to cryptocurrencies, which are often linked to a specific technological product that is being developed or rolled out. When you buy a stock, it is linked to a company that is subject to well-defined financial reporting requirements, which can give you a sense of its prospects.
With cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, discerning which projects are viable can be more challenging. If you have a financial advisor who is familiar with cryptocurrency, it may be worth asking for input.
For beginning investors, it can also be worthwhile to examine how widely a cryptocurrency is being used. Most reputable crypto projects have publicly available metrics showing data such as how many transactions are being carried out on their platforms. If use of a cryptocurrency is growing, that may be a sign that it is establishing itself in the market. Cryptocurrencies also generally make "white papers" available to explain how they'll work and how they intend to distribute tokens.
If you're looking to invest in less established crypto products, here are some additional questions to consider:
Who’s heading the project? An identifiable and well-known leader is a positive sign.
Are there other major investors who are investing in it? It’s a good sign if other well-known investors want a piece of the currency.
Will you own a portion in the company or just currency or tokens? This distinction is important. Being a part owner means you get to participate in its earnings (you’re an owner), while buying tokens simply means you're entitled to use them, like chips in a casino.
Is the currency already developed, or is the company looking to raise money to develop it? The further along the product, the less risky it is.
It can take a lot of work to comb through a prospectus; the more detail it has, the better your chances it’s legitimate. But even legitimacy doesn’t mean the currency will succeed. That’s an entirely separate question, and that requires a lot of market savvy. Be sure to consider how to protect yourself from fraudsters who see cryptocurrencies as an opportunity to bilk investors.

Cryptocurrency Market Cap Explained

On December 18 2024, the total cryptocurrency market capitalisation surpassed a whopping US$3.7 trillion. That remains the all time high for the asset class which has only existed for approximately 15 years.
Yes, that’s a huge number. But without the context, what does it really mean? Is it an indicator of any historical trend, growth potential, or actual dollar amount?
Let’s dive into the most commonly touted crypto statistic: market cap. We’ll discuss what it really means, how it’s calculated, and how this metric could help you make decisions on future crypto investments.

Definition:
In the crypto market, market capitalisation (market cap) is the total dollar value of all coins in circulation. Market cap can be used to measure the value of a specific cryptocurrency, as well as refer to the total capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies in existence.
What is Market Cap in Crypto?
Market cap is a metric used to help traders and investors understand the value or value potential of a particular cryptocurrency. It’s a concept with roots in traditional investing, where market cap is used to quantify the dollar value of shares in circulation for a company. 
The size of a market cap can help investors make inferences about the risk profile of a coin, its potential for long-term growth, and its market dominance.
How is Market Cap Calculated?
There are two common ways to express cryptocurrency market cap: circulating supply or fully diluted supply. Market cap can be calculated by using the number of coins currently in circulation (circulating supply). Or it can be calculated using the number of coins that will be in circulation once the limit is reached (full diluted supply). 
Given that this serves mainly as a tool for making investment decisions in the present, circulating supply is almost exclusively used when calculating market cap. However, if you’re set to be a long term holder it’s worth considering the impacts of a fully diluted supply on your stake.
Market cap based on circulating supply is calculated with the following formula:
Current Price x Circulating Supply = Market Cap
Difference Between Small, Mid, & Large-Cap Cryptocurrencies
When using market cap to discuss cryptocurrencies, they are generally divided into three categories: small, mid, and large-cap.
Small-cap cryptocurrencies
Small-cap cryptocurrencies tend to have market caps under $1 billion. Compared to other coins, they usually have less exchange support, lower volume, or both. For this reason, small market movements can create volatile swings for these small-cap cryptocurrencies.
Mid-cap cryptocurrencies
Mid-cap cryptocurrencies have capitalisations between $1 billion and $10 billion. Traders often look to mid-cap coins to predict growth potential. Yet since these cryptocurrencies haven’t established large-cap positioning, there is still a greater level of risk involved.
Large-cap cryptocurrencies
Large-cap cryptocurrencies with capitalisations of more than $10 billion. These are your ‘household name’ coins; Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and more. These cryptocurrencies have a relatively higher trading volume compared to other crypto assets.

Why Are Large-Cap Cryptocurrencies Considered to Have Lower Risk Profile?
It goes without saying that cryptocurrency investments are more often than not more volatile than stocks or any other traditional investments. That said, investors see large-cap cryptos as stable investments within a volatile market. The large-cap coins which have shown growth over time (not overnight growth) usually have high liquidity, characteristics similar to the largest and long-standing publicly listed companies – stalwarts like General Motors, Ford and other multinational giants.
So if many investors decide to market and sell these larger assets at once, price and market cap drops will be smaller compared to a sell-off of small or mid-cap market assets.
Market Cap vs. Cash Inflow
Market cap and cash inflow are often confused because both are expressed in dollar amounts, but they represent very different concepts.
Market Cap is the total value of a cryptocurrency, calculated by multiplying the current price of one coin by the total number of coins in circulation. It’s a snapshot of the coin’s overall value, not the amount of money that has been invested or is currently in the market.
Cash Inflow, on the other hand, refers to the actual money being invested into the market—new funds coming in to buy the cryptocurrency.
Market cap can change due to fluctuations in the coin’s price, even if no new money is entering or leaving the market. For example, if the price of a coin goes up, the market cap increases, but this doesn’t mean that more cash has been invested.
It’s important to recognise that market cap is not a direct measure of cash inflow; it simply reflects the current value based on price changes and the total supply of coins.
Other Metrics & Ways to Evaluate Cryptocurrencies
While market cap is important, you should never use this number alone to evaluate a potential investment. Below is a list of other things to consider while doing your research.
What is the project solving? i.e. Is there utility?
Do the values of this project align with my values?
What is the overall project ranking?
Read the project white paper, is there anything about the project that seems questionable? (e.g. lack of real-world case use, issues with legality)

Market Cap vs Volume
The relationship between market cap and volume can be speculative. Although one can influence the other in different ways, these influences aren’t an exact science. 
If a coin’s 24-hour trading volume exceeds its market cap in a given period, it could mean investors are speculating about its potential growth. It could mean something, or it could be a temporary trend.
Conversely, Bitcoin has a low trading volume when compared to its market cap (still a high volume otherwise). But since there is less action happening, it doesn’t mean that Bitcoin is losing value. We can probably infer that short-term holders (STHs) are becoming long-term holders (LTHs), reducing the overall liquid supply of Bitcoin. In other words the market is maturing, with lesser speculation at play.

A Beginner's Guide to Day Trading Crypto
Learn all about day trading crypto with this detailed guide. Learn important strategies, tools, and tips to thrive in the dynamic cryptocurrency market.
What Is Day Trading?
Day trading is the business of trading assets within the same day to gain small profits from temporary price fluctuations. In the constantly evolving cryptocurrency world, it’s a race against time and accuracy.
So, what sets day trading cryptocurrency apart? Well, unlike traditional markets that close after hours, the crypto market is open 24/7 for business — and tools like a crypto credit card can help traders earn crypto rewards on daily purchases while staying active in the market. This has the advantage of creating a virtually limitless list of trading opportunities for the traders — though it leaves them open to the significant risk of overtrading or losing steam. 
It relies on the blockchain concept, which is trusted for decentralization as it brings about the transparency and security of the transactions.
Day trading strategies are based on technical analysis, awareness of market sentiment, and keen perception of news that may affect volatility. While this kind of trading is not for everyone, people who like activity and actively engage in a fast-paced trading environment find it very rewarding.
How Much Can a Crypto Day Trader Make?
The earnings of a crypto day trader depend on skill, experience, and market conditions. While some traders boast daily profits of hundreds or even thousands of dollars, others also face steep losses.
There are a few key factors influencing profitability:
Volatility: Coins like BTC and ETH often see significant price swings, creating profit opportunities. 
Risk Tolerance: Profitable traders set clear boundaries for acceptable losses and stick to them.
Scalping Frequency: High-frequency strategies like scalping can lead to small, consistent profits but require focus and discipline. 
Can Day Trading Make a Living?
Some traders make a living through disciplined strategies, but it's not guaranteed. Beginners should focus on building skills and managing risks before relying on trading as a primary income source.
It's crucial to remember that day trading is not a guaranteed path to wealth. Successful traders invest in education, practice, and advanced tools to refine their strategies. 
How To Start Day Trading Cryptocurrency
Starting your journey as a crypto day trader requires preparation and a clear strategy — here’s what to know to start your day trading journey: 
Set a Specific Time Frame
Identify your trading time frame based on your goals and availability. Popular intervals for day traders include 15-minute, 1-hour, and 4-hour charts. Shorter time frames help capture quick price movements, while longer ones allow for broader trend analysis.
Perform Technical Analysis
Technical analysis is the backbone of day trading, and by learning to read candlestick charts and recognize patterns, traders can make data-driven decisions. Tools like moving averages and Bollinger Bands can help you identify trends and entry points.
Practice Risk Management
Effective risk management is key to long-term success. Use stop-loss orders to minimize potential losses and take-profit levels to lock in gains. Never risk more than 1-2% of your capital on a single trading day.
Assess your comfort level with risk tolerance. High volatility can lead to rapid gains — or losses. Setting clear boundaries ensures you stay within your financial limits. 
Is Crypto Day Trading Worth it?
Day trading cryptocurrency offers significant opportunities — but it isn't without challenges. Whether it’s worth your time depends on your goals, risk tolerance, and commitment to learning.
Some of the most attractive advantages of crypto day trading are:
High-Profit Potential: Short-term strategies can generate quick returns.
Flexibility: you can trade anytime, anywhere, making it suitable for remote work.
However, day trading crypto can have a couple of potential downsides, too. For example, day trading requires significant focus and time. Plus, without discipline, the volatility that provides profits can also lead to losses.
If you’re disciplined, well-informed, and equipped with a solid risk management strategy, day trading crypto can be a great rewarding venture.
What Are the Best Indicators for Day Trading Cryptocurrency?
Successful day traders rely on a variety of technical indicators to make informed decisions. Here are some of the key indicators for day trading:
Relative Strength Index (RSI)
RSI estimates the speed of value changes to distinguish overbought or oversold conditions. Divergence among RSI and price trends can demonstrate upcoming reversals.
Moving Averages (MA)
Moving averages track average prices over a specific time frame, revealing trends and price movements. The simple moving average (SMA) provides an average over time, while the exponential moving average (EMA) responds quicker to recent prices. Crossovers between short and long-term MAs are common signals for trend changes.
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
MACD highlights trend reversals and momentum strength. Bullish signs occur when the MACD line crosses over the Signal Line, and bearish signals when it crosses below. Its histogram shows momentum strength, helping with timing entries and exits.
Volume
Volume measures trade activity, confirming trends and market sentiments. High volume during price movements supports trend strength, while low volume can signal weakness. It’s also crucial for validating breakouts and distinguishing real moves from false signals.
To use indicators effectively, it’s generally best to combine multiple indicators for the most holistic, well-rounded view. Try to match indicators with your time frame, too — for example, use RSI for short-term trades. 
What Should You Look For When Day Trading Crypto?
When day trading, choosing the best crypto is critical. Focus on digital assets with high liquidity, significant price movements, and strong market sentiments.
High Volatility
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are known for their rapid price fluctuations. This high volatility creates opportunities for profit within short periods. Traders also monitor the Solana price, as its volatility and growing ecosystem have made it a popular choice for short-term trading opportunities.
High Liquidity
Assets with high trading volume ensure the smooth execution of trades. High liquidity reduces slippage, which is crucial when entering or exciting positions quickly. 
Market Cap
Large-cap cryptocurrencies are more stable and less prone to sudden drops. For beginners, these assets provide a safer entry point.
Market Sentiment
Stay updated on news and events that impact market sentiment. Social media trends, government regulations, and economic developments can all influence trader behavior.  
Resistance Levels
Identifying support and resistance levels helps pinpoint optimal entry and exit points, minimizing risk and maximizing returns.
How Does Market Sentiment Affect Crypto Day Trading?
Market sentiment, the collective mood of traders and investors, significantly impacts crypto day trading. Social media trends, news, and global events can quickly sway prices and trading volumes — for example, a tweet from an influential figure or news of regulatory changes can trigger rapid price shifts.
Leveraging Social Media Trends
Platforms like Reddit and Twitter influence sentiment and traders can monitor trending hashtags and use sentiment analysis tools to gauge market tone.
Responding to News and Events
Positive news, such as corporate adoption, often drives prices up, while negative events, like regulatory crackdowns, can lead to sell-offs. Staying updated with reliable news sources helps traders act swiftly.
Tools for Sentiment Analysis 
Certain tools can help analyze social media trends, measuring metrics like engagement and sentiment scores to predict price movements. 
On-chain analytics platforms can also provide deeper insights, such as tracking how much Bitcoin is moving into or out of exchanges, which can signal shifts in market sentiment. Using these tools together gives traders a clearer picture of how sentiment is likely to affect price action. 
While technical analysis focuses on price trends and patterns, sentiment analysis provides a human-centered perspective, allowing traders to anticipate emotional market reactions. Combining both approaches can lead to more informed and successful trading decisions.
What Are Other Cryptocurrency Trading Strategies?
Diversifying your approach with alternative strategies can improve overall performance.
Arbitrage
Buy low on one exchange and sell high on another. Arbitrage exploits price differences across platforms, offering quick profits with minimal risk. It requires monitoring multiple exchanges simultaneously to act quickly when opportunities arise. 
Scalping
This strategy focuses on small, frequent gains. Scalping requires quick execution and is best suited for assets with high liquidity and low fees. Traders often use short time frames, such as 1-minute or 5-minute charts, to maximize efficiency. 
Range Trading
Trade within defined price ranges by identifying support and resistance zones. This method is ideal for stable market conditions. It works best when the market lacks a clear trend, making price movement more predictable. 
HODL (Buy and Hold)
Hold onto crypto assets despite short-term volatility. This long-term strategy emphasizes potential growth over time. Investors often use this strategy for coins they believe have strong future potential.
Futures Trading
Speculate on future prices without owning the underlying asset. While this strategy offers leverage, it also comes with increased risk. 
Is Day Trading Crypto Legal?
Yes, day trading crypto is legal in most countries. However, the specifics of regulations can vary depending on where you live:
Compliance: Many governments require traders to report capital gains from crypto trading. Ensure that you understand your local tax obligations.
Regulations: Trusted platforms like Gemini, Binance, and Coinbase adhere to local and international laws, providing secure and legal trading environments.
Bans: Some nations have outright banned cryptocurrency trading (e.g., China), while others impose restrictions that limit trading activity.
Make sure to research your country’s cryptocurrency regulations, focusing on taxation and trading permissions. To avoid unsafe crypto trading, go for cryptocurrency exchanges that comply with the financial laws in your jurisdiction. It’s also important to make sure you keep records of all trades, withdrawals, and deposits for tax filing purposes.
If you’re trading in the crypto world, familiarizing yourself with the legal landscape is important — learning the rules early can guard against investment loss and peace of mind.
The Bottom Line
Day trading crypto is an exciting but demanding pursuit — day trading can bring major rewards if you’re willing to put time into learning. By paying attention to market trends and understanding your risk tolerance, you can approach the cryptocurrency market a bit more confidently.
If you know the tools and strategies and have committed to learning, then you can take challenges, convert them into opportunities, and do well in the crypto trading world.

What is USDC (USDC)?
Key takeaways 🔑
USDC (USDC) is a stablecoin whose value is pegged to the US dollar.
USDC debuted in 2018 on the Ethereum blockchain, but is now available on many of the largest blockchains.
The Centre Consortium conceived USDC as an alternative to other popular US dollar backed stablecoins such as Tether (USDT), and focuses on creating transparency surrounding its USD backing.
Summary of USDC 🔍
USDC (USDC) is an asset backed stablecoin whose value is pegged to the U.S. Dollar (USD). 
Every USDC token in circulation is backed by $1 USD in cash or cash equivalents, such as short-term U.S. Treasury bonds held by regulated U.S. financial institutions. USDC has adopted the ERC-20 token standard, making it interoperable with all Ethereum-based applications. The token is now found on many other popular blockchains including Algorand, Solana and Tron. 
The price predictability of USDC has allowed it to serve as a safe haven for cryptocurrency traders during periods of market volatility. USDC also enables a more efficient transaction of value in a stable digital currency across borders than has been the norm from traditional finance. 
USDC’s utility is underscored by its extensive ecosystem of holders and service providers such as decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto trading platforms.


Who created USDC? 👤
USDC was first announced in May 2018 and launched in September the same year by Centre, a joint enterprise between peer-to-peer payment provider known as Circle and one of the largest crypto platforms in the world, Coinbase. 
Centre Consortium strives to provide the governance and standards required to build a digital financial ecosystem. USDC has aimed to improve the regulation, transparency and licensing standards of stablecoins when compared to other stablecoins available in the market today — namely Tether (USDT). 
The project gained the attention of other large players in the financial sector as a result of the founding institutions’ reputation and experience in the industry. USDC was initially backed by $110 million USD from Goldman Sachs and Breyer Capital, among other notable investors.
Buy USDC
How does USDC work? ⚙️
Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, new USDC isn’t released into circulation through the mining process. Instead, new USDC tokens are minted when users and businesses deposit United States government backed currency into their Circle account. A 1:1 representation of that asset, whose record of transactions is recorded and maintained using the efficiencies of blockchain technology, is created by exchanging USD for USDC. 
Conversely, when USDC is deposited in exchange for USD, the tokens are burned to ensure the number in circulation matches the fiat amount held in reserve at all times.
At issuance, the equivalent amount of USD is held in cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries by Circle, ensuring that the value of USDC remains pegged with the value of USD. This means that unlike most cryptocurrencies that can fluctuate in value rapidly, USDC is designed to weather financial downturns with minimal volatility. 
The one-for-one cash holdings that Circle uses to back their coin have allowed it to maintain a reliable peg to the U.S. Dollar, even during periods of extreme market volatility.
While USDC had previously held small amounts of commercial paper, a type of short term debt issued by companies to cover their more immediate liabilities, the company has recently claimed to hold only government backed assets.
As a registered money service business in the U.S., Circle’s holdings are audited by international accounting giant Grant Thornton.
What are stablecoins?
Learn about stablecoins and the important role they play in the crypto ecosystem.
Learn about stablecoins
Why does USDC have value? 🤔
USDC’s stability makes it a reliable currency to use as a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account — the three qualities of money. This has allowed Circle to grow as a means of payment between individuals and corporations around the world.
Those investing in cryptocurrencies, whose price can be subject to volatility, may also hold USDC while waiting for the prices of certain assets to stabilize.
Businesses accept payment in USDC due to its perceived safety and efficiency. USDC holders can transfer the currency throughout the world quickly, often making it a more viable option than traditional channels, such as bank transfers or money wires, for cross-border transactions. 
USDC is also used to transact with a growing number of dApps to earn rewards by loaning or staking a user’s holdings on platforms like AAVE.  Similar lending protocols across the decentralized finance ecosystem have allowed users to earn higher returns on their dollars than traditional bank savings accounts.
Why buy USDC? 🧑‍💻
Crypto investors looking to hold their funds in a safe haven currency during periods of market volatility may find USDC valuable. Unlike other stablecoins which use a algorithm to maintain their peg to the U.S. Dollar, USDC is backed by verified, government backed reserves. 
USDC holders will also find that their tokens can be used to pay for a variety of goods and services via an extensive ecosystem of dApps. USDC’s stable peg also means purchasers and vendors can transact without fear of losing value after a sale has been made — a situation often experienced by those who transact with more volatile crypto assets.
Earn USDC (USDC) rewards
Opt in to earning rewards on your USDC with Kraken, so you can earn 5.5% annual percentage yield (APY) on your USDC.

Trump family's net worth has increased by $2.9 billion thanks to crypto investments, new report says
President Trump's venture into crypto products has increased his family's wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a new report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. 
The group State Democracy Defenders Action estimated in a new report that the president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth — or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with the Trump family that launched in October 2024. State Democracy Defenders Action identifies itself as non-partisan, but it is overseen by frequent critics of President Trump, with an agenda focused on "the autocratic threat to our nation."
The president's net worth is expected to get another bump, with World Liberty Financial's announcement this week that a Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in the Trump family-affiliated crypto fund. The Emirati firm, MGX, will purchase $2 billion in a stablecoin product offered by World Liberty, the company said in a statement to CBS. The currency, called "USD1" will then be used to invest in Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges.
World Liberty has ties to the president and his sons. The fine print on the company's website says an entity affiliated with Mr. Trump and his family members own a 60% stake in the company.
According to the company's public reports, a Trump family entity also holds 22.5 billion of the $WLF tokens –- and takes an additional 75% in net revenue from future token purchases.
Details of the MGX deal have not been released, so it is unclear how much the Trump family stands to benefit from this transaction.
In a statement to CBS News, World Liberty said the deal represents the "single largest-ever investment in a crypto company" and sets a "historic precedent." It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment.
The White House responded to a request for comment by telling CBS News to "report on something people actually care about." A spokesperson provided links to several White House technology initiatives.
As the president's investments in crypto have grown, the Securities and Exchange Commission has paused investigations into a dozen crypto companies since his inauguration, a CBS News analysis found.


"The bottom line is it appears like he's profiting off of his public office," said Virginia Canter, State Democracy Defenders chief counsel for ethics and anticorruption. Canter, who co-authored the new report, served as senior ethics counsel for the Treasury Department under both Republican and Democratic administrations. 
"In terms of prior presidents in the modern age, they've all divested their assets, or they've rolled them over into what we call blind trusts," Canter said. "President Trump did not do that in his first term, and it seems as if in the second term he's doubled down and he is all in (on) the crypto industry."
The report leans heavily on past media reports, including a Fortune magazine article that reviewed the Trump family's financial disclosures and provided the original estimates of the president's net worth.
Crypto companies are not legally required to disclose who is buying and selling on their platforms to the public, so little is known about who has invested in Trump family-affiliated crypto products. 
Canter says this makes it more difficult to identify potential conflicts of interest. 
"In his first administration, we could see who was walking in and out of the Trump hotels," she said.
Trump hopes U.S. will be the "crypto capital of the world"
The president, who as recently as 2021 described crypto currency as a "scam," has since embraced digital currency, saying he hopes to make the United States the "crypto capital of the world."
Since his inauguration, Mr. Trump has made several moves to unwind the regulatory environment that many industry insiders say crippled crypto businesses. 
He has issued multiple executive orders to promote cryptocurrency, including one that seeks to promote the growth of digital currencies and another that instructed the Treasury Department to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. 
Mr. Trump has also used his office to pardon the three founders of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, who pleaded guilty in 2022 to failing to prevent money laundering on their platform, according to a report by Reuters. 
The value of Mr. Trump's crypto assets have at times fluctuated with his policy decisions and social media posts.
The value of $TRUMP increased 18.1% in early March after the president issued an executive order promoting a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, according to the report. A few weeks later, on March 23, the president posted "I Love $TRUMP– SO COOL!! The Greatest of them all!!!!" on Truth Social, which led to an increase in the price of the meme coin from $10.93 to $12.24.
Whether or not the $TRUMP coin increases in value, the president's business collects trading fees when people buy or sell the coin. A Reuters analysis found that business entities behind the $TRUMP coin could have made nearly $100 million in fees in less than two weeks of trading.
World Liberty Finance: The Trump family's crypto exchange
Aside from meme coins, the Trump family's more recent foray into cryptocurrency may become its most profitable. 
In October, then-candidate Trump helped launch World Liberty Finance, a decentralized or "defi" cryptocurrency exchange. Its website, which heavily features the president's image, offers users the opportunity to buy into the exchange using $WLFI tokens. 
"Good News, the World Liberty Financial token is now live. Crypto is the future, let's embrace this incredible technology and lead the world in the digital economy. Go to World Liberty Financial.com," Mr. Trump posted on X in October, before the presidential election. 
The website says World Liberty is "inspired by Donald J. Trump" and Mr. Trump is listed as chief crypto advocate. His sons, Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron, are all listed as Web3 ambassadors. 
Donald Trump Jr. promoted World Liberty Financial in March, at the D.C. Blockchain conference, where crypto industry insiders rubbed shoulders with members of Congress and the administration.
"I'm just super excited about what this can mean for the future of banking for the future of financial systems," said Trump Jr., who joined World Liberty's panel remotely. Founders Chase Herro, Zak Folkman and Zach Witkoff appeared on stage to promote World Liberty's stablecoin offering.

"We want Republicans, Democrats, whether it be black, blue, brown, white, to be using our stable coin," said Zach Witkoff, the son of Steven Witkoff, the White House special envoy to the Middle East. "We think it democratizes finance." 
World Liberty says it has raised more than $550 million from investors who purchase the $WLF governance token. The majority of these investors remain anonymous to the public. For now, these $WLFI tokens are non redeemable, meaning that once they are purchased, users cannot exchange them. 
World Liberty denied CBS' multiple requests for an interview.
Justin Sun, the crypto billionaire famous for buying and eating a $6.2 million banana duct-taped to the wall, is one of World Liberty's few publicly known investors. 
Sun, who was being investigated for securities fraud in the Biden administration, said he invested $30 million shortly after Mr. Trump's election, at the time claiming in a post on X to be World Liberty's"largest investor."
Days before Mr. Trump's inauguration, Sun said he invested another $45 million, which he also disclosed in a post on X. A few weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission reversed itself and asked the judge to grant a stay in Sun's case, citing "public interest." The pause in Sun's case was part of a larger push by the SEC to dismiss cases against crypto companies. 
A spokesperson for Sun and the SEC declined to comment. 
Last month, Democrats on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee sent a letter to the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency about the potential for conflict of interest as the Trump administration considers regulations of companies like World Liberty Financial.
"President Trump's involvement in this venture, as he strips financial regulators of their independence…presents an extraordinary conflict of interest that could create unprecedented risks to our financial system," said the letter, which was signed by five Democrats, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden and Chris Van Hollen. 
World Liberty Financial says 85,000 investors have gone through a standard Know Your Customer process to determine "participation eligibility," and the company says it is arranging for a third-party accounting firm to audit its new venture into the U.S.-debt-backed stablecoins. 
As president, Mr. Trump is not subject to the criminal conflict-of-interest law. But he is required to disclose his assets and income under the Ethics in Government Act, including his crypto assets. The next financial disclosure report deadline for the president is May 15.

Liquidity in Cryptocurrency
The ease with which a digital token can be converted into a digital asset or cash without affecting its price
What is Liquidity in Cryptocurrency?
For any investment, one of the most important considerations is the ability to efficiently buy or sell that asset if and when the investor pleases. After all, what is the point of profit if the seller is not able to realize their gains? The liquidity of the asset will largely determine if and how much of a position a prudent investor will take in the investment – and this extends to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 
Liquidity in cryptocurrency means the ease with which a digital currency or token can be converted to another digital asset or cash without impacting the price and vice-versa. Since liquidity is a measure of the outside demand and supply of an asset, a deep market with ample liquidity is an indication of a healthy market. Additionally, the more liquidity available in a cryptocurrency or digital asset, all things being equal, the more stable and less volatile that asset should be.
In other words, a liquid cryptocurrency market exists when someone is prepared to buy when you are looking to see; and if you’re buying, someone is willing to sell. It means you may buy that digital asset in the quantity that you want, take profit from a trading opportunity, or in the worst case, cut your losses should the value of the asset fall below your costs, all without moving the market dramatically. 
Key Highlights
The ease with which a digital token can be converted into a digital asset or cash without affecting its price is referred to as liquidity in cryptocurrency.
Liquidity in cryptocurrency reduces investment risk and, more importantly, aids in the development of an exit strategy, making it easier to sell your holdings.
Liquidity in cryptocurrency allows for price stability and decreased volatility, as well as assists in the analysis of trader activity.
Importance of Liquidity in Cryptocurrency
The cryptocurrency market is dependent on liquidity. Liquidity in cryptocurrency lowers investment risk and, more crucially, assists in defining your exit strategy, making it simple to sell your ownership. As a result, liquid crypto markets are preferred by investors and traders.
1. Liquidity in cryptocurrency makes it hard to manipulate prices
Liquidity in cryptocurrency makes it less susceptible to manipulations of the market by dishonest actors or groups of actors.
As a fledgling technology, cryptocurrencies currently lack a set path; it is less regulated and contains many unscrupulous people looking to manipulate the market to their advantage. In a deep and liquid digital asset, such as Bitcoin or Ether, controlling the price action in that market becomes difficult for a single market participant or a group of participants.
2. Liquidity in cryptocurrency offers stability in prices and less volatility
A liquid market is considered more steady and less volatile as a thriving market with considerable trading activity can bring buy and sell market forces into harmony.
As a result, anytime you sell or purchase, there will always be market participants prepared to do the opposite. People can initiate and exit positions in highly liquid markets with little slippage or price fluctuation.
3. Liquidity in cryptocurrency helps in analyzing behaviors of traders
Liquidity in cryptocurrency is determined by the number of interested buyers and sellers. Increased market participation means increased liquidity, which can be a signal of increased market data dissemination.
A larger number of both sell and buy orders reduces volatility and gives traders a comprehensive picture of market forces and can help produce more accurate and reliable technical. Traders will be able to better analyze the market, make accurate predictions, and make well-informed decisions as a result.
4. Developments in cryptocurrency liquidity
We are seeing standardized futures markets pop up for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The futures markets allow investors to trade contracts, or agreements, to buy or sell cryptocurrencies at a pre-agreed later date in a developed and transparent manner.
It allows investors to not only to be long or buy and hold a future claim on an asset such as Bitcoin, but also sell BTC short via futures, which means they may take a negative view of Bitcoin without owning it in the first place. The market makers for these futures need to manage their own risk by buying and selling physical cryptocurrencies, thereby deepening the overall market liquidity.
Measuring Liquidity in Cryptocurrency
Liquidity, unlike other trade analysis indicators, has no fixed value. As a result, calculating the exact liquidity of the exchange or market is difficult. However, there are other signs that can be used as proxies for liquidity in cryptocurrencies.
Bid-Ask Spread
The gap between the highest bid (selling) price and the lowest ask (purchasing) price in the order book is known as the bid-ask spread. The narrower the spread, the more liquid a cryptocurrency is said to be.
If a market for a digital asset is illiquid, investors and speculators would expect to see a wider bid-ask spread, making it more expensive to transact in that digital asset.
Trading Volume
Trading volumes are an important factor in determining liquidity in the cryptocurrency market. It refers to the total amount of digital assets exchanged on a cryptocurrency exchange over a given period.
The indicator impacts the market players’ direction and behavior. A higher trade value indicates more trading activity (buying and selling), implying greater liquidity and market efficiency. Lower trade volume means less activity and low liquidity.
Market Size
At present, the size of the overall cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, is still quite small. For example, based on the historical high price that Bitcoin has achieved of around $68,000 USD each and roughly 19 million or so BTC mined, its total market capitalization is around $1.3 trillion, where market capitalization is calculated as the amount of an asset outstanding multiplied by the price of each one of that asset. Industry estimates for the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies in the second half of 2021 is just over $2.5 trillion USD.  
While those might sound like huge amounts of money, we are far from being as large and liquid as other financial markets that professional investors would normally participate in. Let’s look at the market capitalizations of some other assets out there:
US Equity, or stocks: $40 trillion USD
US Fixed Income, or bonds: $47 trillion USD
Global Equities: $106 trillion USD
Global Fixed Income:  $124 trillion USD
Gold: $12 trillion USD

Can you buy crypto with a credit card? See the pros and cons.
Cryptocurrency exchanges and investing apps provide various payment methods, such as ACH bank transfers, debit cards, and credit cards. While not every platform will allow you to purchase cryptocurrency with a credit card, you can do some research and find an exchange that accepts it.
But just because you can purchase crypto with a credit card doesn't mean you should. In addition to the risk of accruing high-interest debt, charging crypto purchases to a credit card could come with cash-advance fees or other complications. Review the pros and cons of this payment method before you decide.
Is it possible to buy crypto with a credit card?
Purchasing crypto with a credit card is possible, but only on certain crypto exchanges and investment apps. Debit cards and ACH bank transfers are more common payment methods.
For example, Robinhood is a popular investment app that allows you to buy crypto through its Robinhood Connect service. However, the only available payment methods are debit cards, bank account transfers, and using your Robinhood Buying Power.
Compare that to the Kraken crypto exchange, where you can buy crypto with a debit or credit card, Apple Pay or Google Pay, your cash balance, or Plaid ACH. However, Kraken requires an eligible verified membership to add a payment card, and you might have to pay fees to use a card.
Can you use credit card rewards to buy crypto?
You can’t redeem most credit card rewards directly for crypto purchases, but there are ways to indirectly purchase crypto with your cash back, points, or miles. Many cash-back credit cards provide two redemption options that could indirectly fund your crypto investments: statement credits and bank deposits.
A statement credit can cover some or all of your credit card balance, including a recent crypto purchase. A bank deposit gives you cash you can use for just about anything, including crypto purchases — if your chosen platform supports ACH transfers.
Why have my crypto purchases been rejected on my credit card?
Financial institutions have different policies regarding purchasing crypto using credit or debit cards. This could include anti-fraud measures, in which case you must contact your bank to confirm the transaction. However, some credit cards may not be accepted on a crypto exchange, so you would have to try an alternative card or payment method.

Why am I being charged a cash advance fee for purchasing crypto with my credit card?
Some banks treat specific types of purchases as cash advances. For example, Chase has a list of purchases it considers “cash-like transactions” that will be treated like cash advances. These include, but aren’t limited to, purchasing lottery tickets, money orders, wire transfers, and cryptocurrency.
Cash-advance terms and conditions vary by card but often include high interest rates and added fees. There’s typically no grace period with the interest rate on a cash advance, so expect interest to start accruing immediately.
If your issuer categorizes a crypto purchase as a cash advance, it's also likely that you won't earn credit card rewards on the purchase.
Which exchanges and investing apps allow credit card crypto purchases?
These are some popular crypto exchanges and investment apps and their accepted payment methods for buying cryptocurrency.
4 steps to buy crypto with a credit card
1. Find a suitable crypto exchange or investment app and set up an account
There are many available crypto exchanges and investment apps where you can buy cryptocurrency. These include exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase and apps like Robinhood and Cash App.
Note that not every exchange or app has access to every type of cryptocurrency. If you want to buy, sell, or exchange a specific type of crypto, you need to find a platform that supports it.
2. If required, fund your account and complete identity verification
Some platforms require you to fund your account with fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar (USD), before you can buy crypto. This could be where you use a credit card to add funds if the platform supports credit card payments.
You might also have to verify your identity through know-your-customer (KYC) verification. This security measure helps ensure you are who you say you are and helps prevent identity theft and fraud.
KYC verification could ask you to provide your address, date of birth, last four digits of your Social Security number, and other personal information.
3. Purchase your desired cryptocurrency
Once your account is set up, it’s time to buy crypto. Most crypto platforms support well-known cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Expect to pay additional transaction fees if you’re using a credit card to make your purchase.
4. Store your crypto
Many crypto platforms automatically store your crypto after you purchase it. This could include holding it in cold storage with no internet connection or hot storage connected to the internet.
You can also move your crypto to your own cold or hot storage, such as a digital crypto wallet mobile app you can access from your phone or a USB drive you must plug into a computer to access.
Pros and cons of buying crypto with a credit card
While purchasing crypto with a credit card is doable, the risks likely outweigh any potential rewards. Get familiar with the terms and conditions of your credit card and crypto exchange, then consider the following benefits and drawbacks before you make a decision.
